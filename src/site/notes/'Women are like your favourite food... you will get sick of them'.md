As a teenager, my father told me and my then boyfriend that we should not get intimate because "Women are like your favourite food. You will get sick of them, if you have the same one too much." 

I don't remember his exact wording, but I remember feeling disposable. And I remember that I have multiple illegitimate siblings and that one of them was born within months of my brother's birth, which means my father was actively cheating on my biological mother while she was pregnant. (So, he definitely got sick of her!)

Anyway, I hope he won't say this kind of thing to my teenage sister.

On the bright side, I try really hard to be entertaining in all ways to my husband, so I guess that could be a good thing. Not so good side, any sign of perceived disinterest makes me wonder if this is the end of the relationship.
