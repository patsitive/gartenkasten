# Kia ora, e hoa! 
> _Welcome, friend_: Start here to explore the garden of ideas

## Welcome to my gartenkasten 🌱🗃️

<p class="vcard">I'm <a class="fn url" href="https://patsitive.co.nz">Pat Oyson-Matthan</a>, a <span class="title">student and life coach</span> living in <span class="adr"><span class="region">Waikato</span>, <span class="country-name">New Zealand</span></span>, and this digital 'garden-box' is where I shake off my fear and learn in public: by sharing ideas and exploring what delights and challenges me.</p>

> Gartenkasten is my whimsical portmanteau of these two thinking and writing models! 
> - '**digital garden**' (`garten`) — where ideas are expected to evolve and interconnect 
> - '`zettelkasten`' (**slip/note box**) — where ideas are atomic and branch off each other 

(Notice how the term is German—and I _don't_ speak it—so I've skipped the 'digital' part 😅 German, I love you for your elegant modularity)
