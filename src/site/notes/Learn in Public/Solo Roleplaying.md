I like to take notes when I interact with any media. It helps my understanding and gives me a chance to hopefully add to the conversation. 

Here are some notes I've taken on roleplaying resources. Where the source relates to group games, I've focussed on solo roleplay: 

[[Learn in Public/Reference/@BanditsKeep2024HowUseRumors\|@BanditsKeep2024HowUseRumors]] - How to introduce and use rumours effectively
