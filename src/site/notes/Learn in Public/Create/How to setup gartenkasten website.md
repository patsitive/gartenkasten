I love my [[Learn in Public/Think/Gartenkasten\|Gartenkasten]] site! 

I know, it's so cool, right? Very [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). ðŸ¥°

If you're interested in the steps to set up your own website similarly to mine, this page contains the instructions.

## How to setup 

### I want a digital garden site like yours! 
- Step 1: Download Obsidian
- Step 2: Use the Digital Garden plugin 
	- [dg-docs.ole.dev](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) for how to set up the Digital Garden plugin and Vercel

--- 

### I want that visual garden in your header!
- That's based on Topobon (mix of javascript and CSS)
	- [Visual garden graph JS](https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/tree/main)â€”adds pretty visual garden view of notes to the header, using Javascript.
- Note: I made some changes to the Topobon component, based on my needs. 
- Step 1: Set-up digital garden website or fork Topobon (or mine!)
	- If you just forked the entire Topobon or my Gartenkasten, then it should work out of the box, but you'll also have all of [uroybd/topobon](https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/commits?author=uroybd)'s notes or my notes on your website...
	- So Step 2a: delete the pages you don't need? ðŸ˜… 
- Step 2b: Already have a website? 
	- You need to copy over some elements from Topobon to make this work
		- forest.njk â€” this inserts the garden into your index page 
		- userUtils.js â€” this generates the garden
		- custom-style.scss â€” the relevant section dictates how the garden should look 
		- .svg images â€” these are the elements that are populated in the garden 
		- See: [Topobon issue #33](https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/issues/33) for notes on integrating Topobon into your garden (you do not need to fork the whole thing if you already have a digital garden set-up)
		- Or see: [Swamp website stack](https://www.paologabriel.com/swamp/website-stack/#a-href-https-hermitage-utsob-me-target-blank-class-external-link-hermitage-a-forest) for extended instructions on deploying Topobon (and also where I saw Topobon in the real world)
- To change the images for the garden map, you need to update the `noteLabels` in `userUtils.js` and update CSS as well


- [Topobon issue #33](https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/issues/33)Â for notes on integrating Topobon into your garden (you do not need to fork the whole thing if you already have a digital garden set-up)
	- `src/site/_includes/components/user/index/header/forest.njk` â€” created a copy of the forest.njk file from topobon â€” 
	- `src/helpers/userUtils.js` â€” replaced with topobon version â€”
	- `src/site/styles/custom-style.scss` â€” copied section of styling into existing file â€” this 
	- `src/site/_includes/layouts/index.njk` â€” inserted `include` for forest.njk

-  Add `noteIcon` to Digital Garden plugin's **pass-through fields**
    
-  Save & re-publish notes to push new frontmatter values
    
-  Icons are pulled from `noteLabels` in `userUtils.js`
    
-  Any value that's a number gets treated like `tree-[x]`
    
-  Any value that matches a `noteLabels` key (e.g. `bee`) works
    
-  Add matching CSS icons separately later
