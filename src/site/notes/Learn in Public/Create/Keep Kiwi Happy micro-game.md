## Project details 

### What did you ship? 
> Part of the [[Learn in Public/Create/30 Ships, 30 Days\|30 Ships, 30 Days]] challenge

KiwiJoy is a micro-game about seeking happiness, even if the boost you get wears off over time. 

### 🌱 Question / Spark
> What was I curious about?

I wanted to know if I could _actually_ ship a game. I've tried to make games before, but they've always been too large in scope. 

### 🧠 Hypothesis / Hunch
> What did I think I knew or want to share?

The ideas that sparked this concept were [[Baseline happiness\|Baseline happiness]] and [[Hedonic adaptation\|Hedonic adaptation]]. Humans return to a set point of happiness, despite changes in circumstances after a given point.

### ✨ How This Relates to the Theme 
> Explicitly link this artifact to your theme. Even a sentence is magic.

Knowing that happiness is fleeting and also that it persists at a certain level is kinda freeing. You don't need to chase happiness if you know that you'll return to a baseline of joy and contentment. In fact, chasing it is kind of futile. No matter how high you take yourself, you will come back down. 🎈

There are probably other books or studies out there about raising your baseline happiness... That would be interesting. Because if you had a very low baseline of happiness, then that doesn't bode well for your overall life satisfaction!

(In the game, Kiwi has a *very low* baseline of happiness. Poor bird.) 

### 🔍 Data / Life Experience
> Lived moment, convo, story, quote, etc.
 
 I first encountered these ideas in [[@Gilbert2006StumblingHappiness\|@Gilbert2006StumblingHappiness]]* (which honestly I should re-read because it's been at least 15 years since I read it...)

*// The nice thing about having a bookworm as a dad is that you can borrow all his books. In my younger years, my dad read a lot of Tom Clancy, but he also had A LOT of non-fiction. Tom Clancy isn't for me, but I love non-fiction!!!! If ONLY I took notes and knew about zettelkasten and [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] back then... 
// I also read a LOT of Newsweek and TIME magazine. No, I wasn't popular. Why do you ask? 🤣*

### 🧰 Scope Notes
**In Scope:**  
- [ ] Sprites: Kiwi the player, Star sprite (good), Angry face sprite (bad)
- [ ] Random stars and angry faces falling down the screen 
- [ ] Basic map 
- [ ] Basic decay mechanic for happiness
- [ ] High score functionality 
- [ ] Basic collision
- [ ] Kiwi stays on the screen (lol)
- [ ] Game over screen 
- [ ] Left and Right controls 
- [ ] Kiwi has basic animations for moving left and right!!!!! 

**Out of Scope (long list encouraged!):**  
- [ ] sound effects
- [ ] music
- [ ] Kiwi speeds up and down 
- [ ] more sprites to represent good and bad events 
- [ ] more complex art 
- [ ] special mode if happiness >= 11 
- [ ] Increase or decrease Kiwi's baseline happiness 
- [ ] 'Too much of a good thing' - e.g. phone sprite initially gives big boost but if you get too many in a span of time, it reduces your happiness heavily (as doomscrolling does!)
- [ ] Parallax background effect or moving background
- [ ] Moving foreground lol 
 - [ ] Mood-based background color changes (low joy = dull palette, high joy = sparkle)
-  [ ] A rest mechanic — standing still slowly raises happiness (behavioral activation/grounding) -- vs right now moving and resting does the happiness decay 
- [ ] In-game text-based event triggers (e.g. "Kiwi remembers a warm hug" = burst of joy)
- [ ] Happiness bar that changes sprite pose or expression
- [ ] Player-named Kiwi (little textbox intro)
- [ ] Pause/Reset menu (for future polish pass)

## 🪞 Reflection 

### 🗂️ Project Modularity 
> What did I re-use from other projects? Link to them (the more you reuse the better! Think like a programmer)

I don't think I managed to reuse anything from an existing project, which is a shame. Hopefully for the next ones... 

### 🧠→✨ Synthesis / Lesson
> What did I learn during the shipment?

I was starting to feel really bad while working on this game. I started thinking I had wasted the day! I wanted to give up, and I felt like it wasn't going anywhere. I had to really think about what the simplest version of this game could be and then just ship THAT. When I hit export after I finished the game, I felt so excited. Like, yay. I did that. 

Also, lol. It was interesting vibe coding? I did some of the game logic, but I admit I asked ChatGPT for help with the more complicated stuff like collision and decay. 
### 🧭 STOP • START • KEEP
- ✖️ Stop: 
	- Trying to remember what I did the day before and work on my project template *during* the project hahahaha 
	- Writing code inside Pico-8 (do it on Pycharm or SOMETHING ELSE)
- 🔁 Start:
	- Recording out of scope ideas in the project note. I think it would be fun if I come back to this project and added to it. Then I could add notes to the Scope info around what was later added (maybe I cross it off the out of scope list and then add a new section to this note) 
- ✅ Keep:  
	- Doing this project 🥹💖

### 🧠 Zettels or Tracts Spawned?
> Any permanent notes, insights, or essays created?

[[Learn in Public/Think/(1B2A) Copy Gamers to Reach Flow State\|(1B2A) Copy Gamers to Reach Flow State]] - I previously wrote this, and I think it applies here in a way. Games have the ability to induce flow state because of the parameters and constraints in which they operate; it's something I try and think about when designing systems in my life-- and I could do a better job around thinking about those parameters and constraints in game programming.
