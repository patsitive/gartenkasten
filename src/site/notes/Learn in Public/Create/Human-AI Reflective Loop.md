The **Human** user provides _input_ in the form of prompts. Prompts can be strengthened by providing more information when answering Kipling's 5W1H for AI prompting. The prompt asks the LLM "Can you" do one of Bloom's higher-order thinking skills (CEAAUR). 

The **AI** model responds by creating _output_. The generated output is computed using the prompt. Higher quality prompts lead to more targeted output, taking into consideration Kipling's 5W1H for AI output generation. The AI answers the input "I did" one of Bloom's higher-order thinking skills.

| WHO      | What role or persona should the AI adopt for resolving this interaction?                     | "Act as a marketer"                                                    | Who is the user?

| WHEN     | What relevant context or background can the user provide to help the AI target its response? | "My business has been running for 5 years. My client avatar is..."     | What additional context do I have about the user's preferences, e.g. recent conversations, custom instructions? | "Client avatar journey map" [conversation] <br>"Client avatar" [custom instructions] |
| WHERE    | What constraints or rules does the user want the AI to adhere to?                            | "Make sure its 500 words at least, follow the template I pasted"       | What domains and constraints are relevant to answering this request?                                            | [Consider domains of marketing, social media...]                                     |

| **Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy**                           | Middle pyramid â†’ grounding output levels in cognitive skills                                          |

| **Sociotechnical systems thinking**            | This whole loop is a system-of-systems view: humans + AI as co-thinkers                               |
