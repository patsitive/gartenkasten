Sampaguita Roces loves tea, plants and new experiences. Finally, she has the chance to combine her passions by going on the road as the owner of a new wandering tea garden cafe. She's promised her mother that they'll find a place to call their own when she finds that 'special someplace'.

On the journey for new tea blends, new friends, new experiences and new places, maybe she'll find her 'special someone' too.  

Look out, world! Sampaguita is on her way.
