## Plot synopsis 

Tender-hearted Amaya is burnt out and tired. Always putting people first, her fear of losing people has pushed her to the limit. It's time to face the past to stop it from repeating. Maybe it's time to accept that invitation to stay with her estranged Aunt. 

{Love Interest} is down on {LI pronoun} luck and homeless after a freak landslide by the old mine wrecked {LI pronoun} home. Everyone is struggling in Aurora. But luckily {Aunt} has opened up her home. In Aurora, they always pay it forward. That's exactly what {Love Interest} is going to do. 

Some ideas: 
- enemies to lovers
- forced proximity 
- small town romance 
- MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE?
