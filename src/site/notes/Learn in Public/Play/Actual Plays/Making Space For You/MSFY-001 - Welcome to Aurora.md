### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

> > [!info] **Roleplay**
> > I will attempt to focus more on action and dialogue of the roleplay than the style of my writing. 
> > (I'm not sure how successful I'll be at this 🤔 — but the idea is to speed up play, while paying attention to story beats. This is an experiment!)

[📖ROLEPLAY]The young woman named [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Player Characters/Amaya/PC-Amaya\|Amaya]] jumps off the wagon, some distance away from Aurora. The wagon driver says there's not much to see there, so they won't be passing by this time.

[📖ROLEPLAY]A dwarf named [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Hubs/TTYOL NPCs#Makisig (Dwarf)\|Makisig]] introduces himself to Amaya.  He tells her about his fledgling plans of potentially reopening the old town mine, as they walk/ride side-by-side. Amaya **promises** to find out what the townies think of his plans. 

Amaya waves him on — he's on a horse! He shouldn't have to wait for her. He goes.

[📖ROLEPLAY] Amaya makes it to town and her Aunt spots her straight away! The two talk right where they are, and Amaya asks about the state of the town. Aunt Eskama talks about a large payment that the **town** had to pay to buy out the old owners and _safely_ close down the **mine** — townies were split on whether to do it or not.

##### Day left: ⌚⌚

> [!warning]+ NEWBIE MISTAKE ALERT
> **💭 Commentary:** I was fixing the formatting of this Actual Play when I realised that I was doing things wrong. :( 
> In-game Amaya was doing things related to Promises. These actions should have been **Move: Try Your Best** (and not just roleplay where I use Ask Spirit of the Forest or use MUNE). So I have accidentally completed more Moves in a day than I was allowed 🫠 
> I was also inconsistent with **Move: Time Passes**.
> I have left the mistakes as-is and will play correctly going forward 💗

> [!info]-  **🔮 Oracle:** Does Aunt Eskama want the mine to reopen? 
> - Oracle type: MUNE > Fair
> - Result: No
> - Interpretation: Amaya now knows a little about Aunt [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/NPCharacters/NPC-Eskama (Human)\|NPC-Eskama (Human)]]'s poor opinion about the mine reopening. But she doesn't know about what she's planning to do about it.

[📖ROLEPLAY] Amaya and Aunt Eskama eat together and hang out at the **Old Mine Museum**. Amaya bravely asks about what happened all those years ago. Aunt Eskama says it's too early to ask. And to make up for her silence, she gives her a gift from the museum shop. 

 The gift is a **Pink Flute**. Amaya does NOT know how to play this, but she can use it to call animals? 
 
Aunt Eskama has arranged for her to meet and greet people she could **work with** while she lives in Aurora. Everyone who lives here works to help each other out and make sure everyone is fed. 

Amaya and Aunt Eskama finish eating. 

Amaya says she remembers where the old house is and will come find her around dinnertime. It might be Rest Day, but she feels like wandering around. Aunt Eskama recommends checking out the Request Board.

[📖ROLEPLAY] **Nubelli** fly overhead, and Amaya plays the flute (badly). Two Nubelli like it and decide to swoop at her. She ducks and they keep swooping at her playfully. They show signs of wanting to come home with her. Someone sees the swooping birds and Amaya waving her arms. That person starts yelling while rushing towards them. Amaya is startled and freezes. The two Nubelli settle on her shoulders.     

The stranger says they were worried that someone would get hurt. Amaya says it's... fine. It's not really fine, Amaya's spooked, so she decides to head back. She leaves the stranger.

Excuse me—he lives here? Yes, his house got destroyed in a recent landslide, and Eskama took him in for now. He has no family left. 

Amaya feels bad, and she apologises. He apologises for coming across creepy. They introduce themselves. They have dinner with Aunt Eskama. It's kind of awkward... but it's... fine. It's Day 1, Amaya omg. She tells herself to let it go and not hold a grudge just because he yelled at her earlier.

[📖ROLEPLAY] It's time for bed. Where is everyone sleeping? What? Both Amaya and Stefan are staying in the living room? What? Okay, the **room** that was going to be Amaya's got damaged recently. Need to repair it before she can stay there. Right. She holds her tongue even though she's thinking she could have delayed her move to Aurora until she had her own room... She promises herself that she'll get that room sorted as soon as she can. Good night.

That's it for the episode, folks!

## Reflection 

The Enemies to Lovers thing is kinda promising at the moment, except for Amaya's people-pleaser doormat tendencies... Hmmm... Stay tuned. 

Also, I appreciate that I can play for a bit, do something else, then come back two days later haha.
