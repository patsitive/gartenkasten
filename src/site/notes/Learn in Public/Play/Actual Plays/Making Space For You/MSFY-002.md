### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

[📖ROLEPLAY] Stormy weather keeps everyone inside — even if it *is* Bread Day. Aunt Eskama, Stefan and Amaya get started on repairs to Amaya's would-be **room**. The Nubelli are helping with dehumidifying at the air too. It's a start, and it's **good company**... mostly.

[📖ROLEPLAY] They also have a great conversation about what's changed in **town**. They don't know anything about Hollow's **haunted** house though–ah well, not everyone is attuned to magical energy. Amaya is making progress on her promises to herself!

{ #001b}


[📖ROLEPLAY] On the **Nubelli** — although they aren't Pigeons, these birds are beautiful in looks and song. Amaya is delighted to find that they can mimic the holy coos of the Pigeons when receiving care. The **storm** still rages outside, and maybe she still feels a bit weird about living with an aunt she hasn't seen in nearly two decades and some elf she screamed at the day before—but with animals? She was good. She could breathe. Although maybe she needed a better space for them. They were both staying in the living room with her... and Stefan who is studiously reading some thick probably dusty tome. 

Aunt Eskama comes into the living room, holding something. It's a deck of cards she's just found in a big pile of her things—yes, we may need to did the house of some things—no, not right now. Let's play cards. So they do—and Stefan joins in. The Nubelli sing in the background, floating around them, while a storm rages outside. 

While playing cards, Aunt Eskama assures you that even though the **town** look rundown after the mine closure and yes even her house is in disrepair—people in Aurora are happy. "We take care of each other," she said, a bit choked up.

"We really do," Stefan said. He smiles at Amaya's Aunt gratefully. "You took me in, and I'll always be grateful for that." 

Stefan then offers barista-grade hot chocolate to all, except the Nubelli who are content to float through the air. It's delicious. It seems with what little they have, they make the most of it. 

As Amaya sips her hot chocolate, she wonders—if this town looks after each other, then why did her family have to leave?

[📖ROLEPLAY] Amaya decides that since she committed to looking after herself and not just others, she will learn to play the **flute**—for her and no one else.  Well. Maybe it's for the animals too.

> - **💭 Commentary:** I think the direction I'm taking this is that for whatever reason Amaya views anything Stefan does with suspicion, and it can maybe be a one-sided enemies thing where he thinks they're getting along because with her people-pleaser tendencies she doesn't show her distaste (so he doesn't realise that she's taking things he does the wrong way? You know how depending on the person, you might interpret an interaction differently?) Like, it'll be so funny that his Favour meter will keep going up, but her internal one will be like "I HATE YOU" all because he thought she was harassing the Nubelli lol and was going to get hurt / hurt them by accident 

[📖ROLEPLAY] Amaya ducks into a dark, leaking corridor with her flute. It is crammed with stuff, so she doubts anyone will catch her embarrassing herself here. Even the Nubelli haven't followed her. She blows haltingly into the **flute** for a while, testing it out. After a while, she thinks that maybe she improved... slightly. 

She makes to leave her hiding spot and notices a sandwich next to her, with a note that reads 'Keep going! -Auntie'. Amaya blushes, embarrassed to be caught out. 

Later, after Amaya had eaten her sandwich (sharing a bit with the Nubelli!), Stefan tells her that he can help her with the flute, since he plays a few instruments. She does not take this well, but she doesn't want to argue. She offers a non-committal sound, which he may or may not take as agreement. Aunt Eskama thinks it is a great idea.

[📖ROLEPLAY] During dinner — pasta puttanesca, one of Amaya's favourites — **Aunt Eskama** mentions that today was supposed to be Community Garden Day, but with the storm it was likely postponed until the next day of good weather. Amaya says she'll **check it out** to start getting to know people in Aurora. **Stefan** offers to take her to the community garden, but she waves him off, saying she can figure it out. (She isn't incompetent...).

[📖ROLEPLAY] They're all in the kitchen, while Stefan cleans up the dishes. He's made them both hot chocolate (which she likes but takes with suspicion).  Aunt Eskama is telling her that Animal Husbandry is very important to Aurora, so she can be really helpful. Stefan agrees with her and highlights the good work the **animal-related-job townies** do. Amaya performs mental gymnastics to assume that he is saying she is out of her depth here.

[📖ROLEPLAY] Aunt Eskama gives Amaya a leather journal with some notes about the town to help her settle in. Amaya thanks her and gives her a **warm hug**. It has been a long time since they've embraced. 

Time for bed.

That's it, folks! 

## Reflection 

I am having so much with my Iron Valley-only playthrough. I'm setting it up so it's a one-sided Enemies to Lovers where the elf is genuinely trying to be helpful, but she keeps taking it the wrong way, and because she is such a conflict-avoidant people-pleaser she will NOT actually tell him that she's getting angrier and angrier at him. And then to top it off it is Forced Proximity because he's become homeless and living in her Aunt's house that she has just moved into. 

I'm looking forward to the continued misunderstanding 😂 

Their meet-cute
Him: oh no! These birds are attacking her! Better help! /yells 
Her: he thinks I'm hurting these birds?? EXCUSE ME

He's following her home
Him: not really thinking about it, that's his route home, he's thinking about his internal problems 
Her: why is this weirdo FOLLOWING ME

He offers to teach her how to play the flute 
Him: I want to help! :) 
Her: omg I'm new to this—LAY OFF 

Let's go to community garden day 
Him: I can show you around :) 
Her: I KNOW HOW TO WALK AROUND, SIR 

So all this time, his Favour meter is going up, and internally she is getting angrier and angrier but outwardly being polite at declining or being non-commital. So he's like oh yay new friend (but busy with his own stuff) and she's like "this elf is so sanctimonious, I hate him"

I'm checking out TV Tropes and thinking about which I can lean into to keep developing this storyline in the background 😂 Maybe I can set up an Oracle that is specifically for setting up their disastrous relationship
