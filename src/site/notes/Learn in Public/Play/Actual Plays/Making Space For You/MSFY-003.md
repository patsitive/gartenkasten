### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

 [📖ROLEPLAY] Amaya and her Aunt head to the **Community Gardens** to check out the festivities. It looks like a lot of the town has come out to help out. Although there may be a risk for heat stroke, so everyone will take shelter if needed. Or perhaps leave the garden work early and visit with each other instead. It is Friends Day, after all.  

Aunt Eskama pointed out a blue-haired woman hard at work at one of the plots. She's accompanied by a young child. Apparently that was Hollow, the one with a request relating to a haunted house. Amaya wondered how she could help as they approached. 

Hollow noticed them, and Aunt Eskama was quick to introduce Amaya to the woman and her child. Before she knew it, Amaya was kneeling between Hollow and Spruce, chatting about today's festivities while tending to the plants. The hot sun felt good against her skin for now. 

After a time, Spruce lost interest in the garden work and dashed off to play with some other children. "So, about your request at the community board...?" Amaya let the question hang in the air, as she heaved fresh compost into the ground. 

Hollow sighed. She glanced around to check that her daughter was still preoccupied before she talked about the alleged **haunting**. It turned out that Spruce heard strange sounds at night and was now convinced that there were ghosts. 

"I've tried to show her where the sounds were coming from, but she's convinced there's a ghost!" Hollow blew a wayward strand of hair out of her face. "I need you to convince her that the house is definitely not haunted."

Hollow's eyes turned sad. "She's currently staying with my mum. She won't even come home."

Eskama reached over and squeezed Hollow's shoulder in support, and so did Amaya before she got up and dusted herself off. She smiled confidently at the pair of women. "Why don't we tour the garden while we think on how to get your girl home?"

[📖ROLEPLAY] Amaya spent time with her Aunt and Hollow, getting to know each other while talking about ways to coax Spruce to **return home.** Unfortunately Amaya got the sense that she would be better off looking for inspiration on her own; Hollow was too close to the problem. But it was still nice to spend time with the two older ladies, without any burden of expectation. 

A hunched figure approached them, still towering over them despite its advanced age. It was Tapang one of the elders in Aurora had come to pass on some safe advice to Hollow, and it had begun to speak about it. But it was quickly distracted by the reality that young Amaya who had left the town nearly two decades ago had returned. She accepted its bone-crushing hug and vowed to **spend time** with Tapang.

Tapang again insisted that it would need to see Amaya again while she was in Aurora. The young woman agreed. The elder nodded, the shining tips of its tusks catching the light. Abruptly, Tapang strode assuredly away and Amaya  marvelled at the quiet wisdom and confidence that seemed to emanate from the old orc, which contrasted its stooped posture.

As Tapang stopped to speak with another group of townies, Hollow and her Aunt resumed chatting companionably again. Amaya decided she would ask about Makisig's **plan**. A whistle sounded. Her **Aunt** patted her on the shoulder and said it was time to harvest the crops that were ready to take home; she he quickly forgot about Makisig and the mines. Amaya tried to bolster **Hollow's** spirits by telling her about life in the big city, as they whiled the time away.

The three have taken a break under one of the shaded spots. Only, now there were more of them, enjoying the day out. At some point, Amaya mentioned the Nubelli she found in the forested area around town. That took the wildlife rescuer's mind off her problems, and she straight away brought Amaya (and Aunt Eskama) to a spry-looking orc sitting in the shade. The orc, named Nailea, turned out to be the local Rancher and someone much older than Tapang. Her eyebrows were dark, thick and very arched, giving her a sharp and deceivingly youthful countenance. Hollow and Nailea spoke about the kind of **work** they did and how Amaya could help not only animals but the Aurora community. Amaya was excited. She could see how her experience helping her Papa would be useful in Aurora. 

A goat butted its head against Amaya playfully but soundly. Amaya winced at the force, but Nailea barked out a laugh. They said the goat was to come home with her now. Amaya wasn't quite sure where they would stash the goat, given the condition of the house—but she wasn't sure she could say no. And her Aunt didn't voice any concerns either.
