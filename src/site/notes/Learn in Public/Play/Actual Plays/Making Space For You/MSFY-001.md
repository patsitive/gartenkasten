### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

### Plot

 **💖 _[[Learn in Public/Play/Making Space for You\|Making Space for You]] is a solo roleplay playthrough set in the Iron Valley TTRPG system._

## Plot synopsis 

Tender-hearted Amaya is burnt out and tired. Always putting people first, her fear of losing people has pushed her to the limit. It's time to face the past to stop it from repeating. Maybe it's time to accept that invitation to stay with her estranged Aunt Eskama. 

Stefan is down on his luck and homeless after a freak landslide by the old mine wrecked his home. In Aurora, people look after each other even when they're all struggling. So when Eskama offers him a place to stay, he says yes — he'll find a way to repay her kindness and pay it forward. 

Some tropes I'm trying to explore in the roleplay: 
- (One-sided?) enemies to lovers
- forced proximity 
- small town romance 
- MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE?

[📖ROLEPLAY]A dwarf named [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Hubs/TTYOL NPCs#Makisig (Dwarf)\|Makisig]] introduces himself to Amaya.  He tells her about his fledgling plans of potentially reopening the old town mine, as they walk/ride side-by-side. Amaya **promises** to find out what the townies think of his plans. 

Amaya waves him on — he's on a horse! He shouldn't have to wait for her. He goes.

[📖ROLEPLAY]Amaya makes it to town and her Aunt spots her straight away! The two talk right where they are, and Amaya asks about the state of the town. Aunt Eskama talks about a large payment that the **town** had to pay to buy out the old owners and _safely_ close down the **mine** — townies were split on whether to do it or not.

##### Day left: ⌚⌚

> [!warning]+ NEWBIE MISTAKE ALERT
> **💭 Commentary:** I was fixing the formatting of this Actual Play when I realised that I was doing things wrong. :( 
> In-game Amaya was doing things related to Promises. These actions should have been **Move: Try Your Best** (and not just roleplay where I use Ask Spirit of the Forest or use MUNE). So I have accidentally completed more Moves in a day than I was allowed 🫠 
> I was also inconsistent with **Move: Time Passes**.
> I have left the mistakes as-is and will play correctly going forward 💗

> [!info]-  **🔮 Oracle:** Does Aunt Eskama want the mine to reopen?

> - Result: No
> - Interpretation: Amaya now knows a little about Aunt [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/NPCharacters/NPC-Eskama (Human)\|NPC-Eskama (Human)]]'s poor opinion about the mine reopening. But she doesn't know about what she's planning to do about it.

[📖ROLEPLAY] Amaya and Aunt Eskama eat together and hang out at the **Old Mine Museum**. Amaya bravely asks about what happened all those years ago. Aunt Eskama says it's too early to ask. And to make up for her silence, she gives her a gift from the museum shop. 

 The gift is a **Pink Flute**. Amaya does NOT know how to play this, but she can use it to call animals? 
 
Aunt Eskama has arranged for her to meet and greet people she could **work with** while she lives in Aurora. Everyone who lives here works to help each other out and make sure everyone is fed. 

Amaya and Aunt Eskama finish eating. 

Amaya says she remembers where the old house is and will come find her around dinnertime. It might be Rest Day, but she feels like wandering around. Aunt Eskama recommends checking out the Request Board.

Need to repair it before she can stay there. Right. She holds her tongue even though she's thinking she could have delayed her move to Aurora until she had her own room... She **promises** herself that she'll get that room sorted as soon as she can. Good night. 

That's it for the episode, folks!

## Reflection 

The Enemies to Lovers thing is kinda promising at the moment, except for Amaya's people-pleaser doormat tendencies... Hmmm... Stay tuned. 

Also, I appreciate that I can play for a bit, do something else, then come back two days later haha.
