### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

### Interaction Modes 
**This Actual Play episode page is typically organised by mode of interaction:**
- WATCH or LISTEN: Check out the embedded Youtube video where I talk through my Actual Play and share my computer screen. It's the chatty version. 🎙️
- READ (or LISTEN via screen reader): Check out the textual version, where I write out the game as if I'm writing a novel 😂

Sooo... pick your poison! I know I have different preferences, based on mood hehe. 

If it's missing one of these modes, either I messed up my templates 🫠 or I changed what modes I offer for this adventure at some point during the campaign/playthrough 🤔. 

I am committed to accessibility, and I recognise this is an ongoing journey to achieve universal design. 🤔 If I miss the mark, I humbly ask for you to message me with compassion to say how I can do better.💗

#### Year 1 — Summer 24 

> [!info]- **📌 Location**: [[LOC-Big City\|LOC-Big City]]

Sampaguita pulled the door open, yanking at it with more force than needed. She found herself off-balance, her midnight black hair thrown back suddenly. The woman held fast to the wood, steadying herself and smoothing out her wide blue skirts. 

"I told you it's in good condition," chided a sour voice. 

Sampaguita paid the gnome no mind, stepping into the carriage. In her experience, doors tended to stick more than not or couldn't be trusted to stay shut. Inside, she took stock of the rounded space with its sloped ceiling and curved walls. On the far wall was a large window with stained glass extending nearly from corner to corner. What little winter sun was available streamed in, bathing the space in a warm glow and rainbow hues. Beneath the window lay a solid wood cabinet with many drawers. To its right was a plush seat.

> [!info]- **💭 Commentary:** Who just spoke? I chose!
> - The carriage-seller is a masculine gnome who goes by he/him. 
> - 👤 **NEW Character**:  ➕️  [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/NPCharacters/NPC-Bayabas (Gnome)\|NPC-Bayabas (Gnome)]]

"That pulls out into your bed," declared the gnome, as he shut the door behind him. Surprisingly, there was plenty of room for the two of them. He stepped past Sampaguita and tugged at the seat cushion. "It goes like— well, it goes like," he huffed, pulling at something under the seat. 

Cocking her head, Sampaguita easily lifted the cushion for him. "Thanks," chirped the gnome, before he unfolded hinged wooden slats. The merchant patted at the wood base. "Now the bedding," he declared, pointing meaningfully at the thick material Sampaguita held. She tugged at it, and the material unfurled to reveal its new form as a mattress. 

"Clever engineering," said the gnome smugly. "A half-orc physician ordered this custom, so he always had a place to stay, no matter how far his patients lived. Noticed the high ceilings, aye?" 

Sampaguita turned slowly and noted that except for the large window, cabinet and bed, there was only the open door, two round windows and bare walls. The ceilings were, she agreed, a good height. 

"That no-good physician changed his mind only after I'd gotten the bed sorted," the gnome groused. "Of course, if I had been further along with the build, this might be out of your price range, girlie?"

Sampaguita turned to face the merchant, frowning down at him. "So it's unfinished? Will it even last the winter?"

Although no stranger to leaky homes, Sampaguita felt that her grand adventure deserved a respectable backdrop. Leaks would only harm her plans, not to mention damage the carriage itself. She knew all about that. 

The gnome scoffed. "I built this carriage me-self. It's good construction!" He thwacked his open palm against the walls. "See? Solid timber."

Tucking a lock of hair behind her ear, Sampaguita assessed him. "But you said it's unfinished. How can you say it's good then?" 

"Bah!" spat the gnome. "Left the inside to the last, I did. This will hold against any weather, mark my words."

Sampaguita only hummed in response, as she unlatched the windows and tested them. Shrill shrieking accosted their ears as the windows opened wide. 

The gnome winced. "That's me baby. I better hurry home to help the wife." He tapped his foot nervously. "Look, this carriage has been sitting here for four months now," he began. "I'll do you a deal, if you take it off my hands today."

Sampaguita frowned again. She wasn't planning on making such a large purchase after only a short inspection. She didn't even have a horse, and she said as much to the gnome. 

"You could pull it yourself. You're big enough," he huffed. At <abbr title="5'7">175cm</abbr>, he might be right about that. She was a good head taller than most humans around. "My missus is sick of this city, and this is the last of the large wares I need to sell." The distant shrieking continued. 

Sampaguita carefully shut the windows and noticed it kept out the shrill cries. That would be handy on her travels, she supposed. 

"I have yet other carriages to view," she stated primly. "It would have to be a very good deal for me to make a decision today." 

The gnome sighed. "You'll be needing something to draw the carriage, you said?" 

The dark-eyed woman nodded, looking around the carriage for any signs of damage or neglect. You never knew with these merchant types.

The gnome sighed again and reached high on his tiptoes to open the door. He stuck his head out and whistled. Sampaguita followed him, looking out. He only came up to about mid-calf for her, so it was easy to see what he was looking at.

At the whistle, a donkey ambled towards them. Its coat was shiny, long, and sorrel in colour. Its eyes were bright and brimming with intelligence. The animal came to a stop by the carriage and brayed, shaking its long mane and tail. Sampaguita thought it looked _beautiful_ but wasn't sure it was up to the task. 

"Donkey's as good as a horse. Maybe better—and cheaper," intoned the gnome, catching the look on her face. He held out his hand. "Good enough a deal?"

Sampaguita blinked at the gnome. "What's its name?"

"_His_ name is your business, not mine."

"How do I care for him then?" she countered. 

"How were you planning to care for a horse?" The gnome raised a brow at her. 

Blinking again, Sampaguita mulled the matter over. Donkeys were known for their strength and their hardiness, after all. At her size, she thought she might look ridiculous straddled on a donkey. But she needed a donkey to draw the carriage not for jaunts down a promenade. Sampaguita inwardly chuckled at the idea and fished out her purse from under her skirts. She handed over all of her gold and most of her silver.

> [!fail]- **🎲 Dice:** Will the merchant gnome accept her payment?
> - Roll type: 1d6 > [3]
> - - Result: No.
> - - Interpretation: OMG I need this carriage to make the story work LOL. I'll need to try again somehow LOL. 

The gnome did not look impressed. "This is a fine carriage, and I have fetched you an animal, to boot." The donkey snorted as if to agree. "This will not do."

Pursing her lip, Sampaguita handed over the rest of her silver, leaving only precious few bronze coins in her purse. 

The gnome's frown deepened. "Look," he began, but he was cut off by a yowling noise. He blanched and pushed the coins back into Sampaguita's hands. "I have to go—the baby..."

He was pushing Sampaguita out the door with surprising strength for his size. Before Sampaguita could dig her heels in, she was already out on the cobblestones and the carriage door locked. 

The merchant climbed aboard the donkey, muttering to himself about time-wasters. Sampaguita steeled herself with a deep breath and moved to stand in front of the donkey. 

"How much more do you need, sir?" She looked him straight in the eye. "This is all I have. Please. I'm desperate to leave the city."

The gnome adjusted his hat and frowned up at her. Despite being astride a donkey, he still had to look up at the tall human. He opened his mouth to speak but winced instead upon hearing renewed screeching. He tugged at the donkey's reins, and the two began to trot in the direction of the screams. 

"I can help with your baby," Sampaguita pleaded. She jog-walked to keep apace. "I have a blend that's chamomile-based—many mothers swear by it."

Well, two mothers swore by it, and one was her own from when she was a wee babe. 

The gnome cast her a disbelieving look. "If true, you would have untold riches," he deadpanned. 

Her cheeks reddened, and she told herself it was from the exertion. "I work—I don't have the time to forage—this was to be my new start," she got out, not sure how to prove this to him.

They were now in front of another carriage, evidently the source of the screaming. The door swung open as the gnome carefully climbed off the donkey. 

A lady gnome emerged from the carriage, looking harried and rocking a baby. 

> [!info]- **💭 Commentary:**  Picked his name!
> [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/NPCharacters/NPC-Bayabas (Gnome)\|NPC-Bayabas (Gnome)]] means guava fruit in Tagalog. 

The gnome frowned in concern. "I tell you what," he began. "Knock on my door if you can help with me baby." He sighed. "I help me wife, but my babe is crying all the time..." 

Shoring up his shoulders, the gnome gave Sampaguita a grim smile. "The name's Bayabas if you come knocking." Then he rushed to his family, forgetting all about Sampaguita as he took over the thankless yet important task of rocking a screaming baby.
