### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

[[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Player Characters/Sampaguita/PC-Sampaguita\|Sampaguita]] Roces loves tea, plants and new experiences. Finally, she has the chance to combine her passions by going on the road as the owner of a new wandering tea garden cafe. She's promised her mother that they'll find a place to call their own when she finds that **'special someplace'**.
On the journey for new tea blends, new friends, new experiences and new places, maybe she'll find her **'special someone'** too.  
Look out, world! Sampaguita is on her way. 
_[[Learn in Public/Play/Tea Time with Your Orc Lover\|Tea Time with Your Orc Lover]] is an adventure set in the Iron Valley and Wandering Tea Garden TTRPG systems._

> > This actual play series will be **written in third-person prose and 'performed' on video by the roleplayer**. Roleplay game elements like dice rolls, Oracle pulls, and roleplayer comments will be denoted through callouts with emojis to specify type. (I like emojis! 💗)
> > I'm experimenting with both third-person prose and bulleted shorthand to see if I have a preference! ✨🤔

### Interaction Modes 
**This Actual Play episode page is typically organised by mode of interaction:**
- WATCH or LISTEN: Check out the embedded Youtube video where I talk through my Actual Play and share my computer screen. It's the chatty version. 🎙️
- READ (or LISTEN via screen reader): Check out the textual version, where I write out the game as if I'm writing a novel 😂

Sooo... pick your poison! I know I have different preferences, based on mood hehe. 

If it's missing one of these modes, either I messed up my templates 🫠 or I changed what modes I offer for this adventure at some point during the campaign/playthrough 🤔. 

I am committed to accessibility, and I recognise this is an ongoing journey to achieve universal design. 🤔 If I miss the mark, I humbly ask for you to message me with compassion to say how I can do better.💗
