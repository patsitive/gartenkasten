### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emailsâ€”maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!â€”whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

## Plot synopsis 

Tender-hearted Amaya is burnt out and tired. Always putting people first, her fear of losing people has pushed her to the limit. It's time to face the past to stop it from repeating. Maybe it's time to accept that invitation to stay with her estranged Aunt. 

{Love Interest} is down on {LI pronoun} luck and homeless after a freak landslide by the old mine wrecked {LI pronoun} home. Everyone is struggling in Aurora. But luckily {Aunt} has opened up her home. In Aurora, they always pay it forward. That's exactly what {Love Interest} is going to do. 

Some ideas: 
- enemies to lovers
- forced proximity 
- small town romance 
- MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE?

### Interaction Modes 

**This Actual Play episode page is designed to be read or listened to.**

I use bullet levels and emojis to help convey semantic meaning, and I've tried to make this screen reader or text-to-speech compatible. 

Sooo... pick your poison! I know I have different preferences, based on mood hehe. 

I am committed to accessibility, and I recognise this is an ongoing journey to achieve universal design. ðŸ¤” If I miss the mark, I humbly ask for you to message me with compassion to say how I can do better. ðŸ’—

### **One-line synopsis:**
{{one-sentence logline}}

### Events 

#### Year 1 Summer 5 

- [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Player Characters/Character-Amaya\|Amaya]] jumps off the wagon, some distance away from [[MSFY-Location-Aurora\|MSFY-Location-Aurora]]. The wagon driver says there's not much to see there, so they won't be passing by this time. 
- [x] {Does the wagon driver do anything as she says goodbye?} Fair > No
- Amaya waves goodbye and starts the long trek to the small town she used to live in. Lucky she wore her work boots. Aunt doesn't have a spare donkey to come get her. 
- [x] {Does she run into anyone on the way to Aurora?} Fair > Yes
- [x] {Is this person a resident of Aurora?} Likely > No, but 
	- {Partly generated} Dwarf. Male. Adult. Name: Makisig. Friendly.
	- He does not live in Aurora but he is thinking about reopening the mines â€” or using that area for something else. His gold could be the injection the local economy needs to get back on track. Or bring about its ruin? 
- The stranger waves at Amaya. He's on a horse.  After introducing himself, [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/TTYOL NPCs#Makisig (Dwarf)\|TTYOL NPCs#Makisig (Dwarf)]] tells you about his fledgling plans as you walk/ride side-by-side. 
- **Make a promise**: Ask around about what the townies think of this plan (2 progress boxes)
- Amaya waves him on â€” he's on a horse! He shouldn't have to wait for her. He goes. 
- [x] {Does anything else happen before she gets to Aurora?} Fair > No, and 
	- No, nothing else happens, and yet Amaya gets to **Root Around** just before she gets to the town
	- {What does Amaya find?} `d100 = 47` > Wild Honey x 1
- **Time Passes**: 1/4 
- Amaya makes it to town and her Aunt spots her straight away! 
- [x] {Generate Aunt: partially generated} > [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/TTYOL NPCs#Eskama (Human Aunt)\|TTYOL NPCs#Eskama (Human Aunt)]]
- [x] **Try Your Best**: Have a joyful reunion with Aunt Eskama {Check Action roll + Heart} >
	- Action die + Heart: 1d6 > 4 + 2 + 1 (Inquire skill) = 7 
	- Challenge dice: 2d10 > [9, 1]
	- Weak hit! 
		- [x] {Prompt: Why the rundown-ness?} > Majestic consequence
			- Aunt Eskama talks about a large tax that the town had to pay to _safely_ close down the mine â€” townies were split on whether to do it or not.
			- 1 tick to [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Player Characters/MSFY-Promise Tracker-Amaya#Find out what caused Aurora to get so rundown (6)\|MSFY-Promise Tracker-Amaya#Find out what caused Aurora to get so rundown (6)]] + 1 for Inquire skill 
			- [x] {Does Aunt Eskama want the mine to reopen or be used for something?} > Fair: No
			- 1 tick to [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Player Characters/MSFY-Promise Tracker-Amaya#Ask around about what the townies think of this plan (2)\|MSFY-Promise Tracker-Amaya#Ask around about what the townies think of this plan (2)]]
	- **Time Passes**: 2/4
		- +1 Favour to [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/TTYOL NPCs#Eskama (Human Aunt)\|TTYOL NPCs#Eskama (Human Aunt)]] 
	- [x] Time for a late lunch but {Where to eat?} > Location: Town > Deep museum
		- The [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/TTYOL-All Locations#Old Mine Museum\|TTYOL-All Locations#Old Mine Museum]] also serves food. And it's even open on Rest Days. 
		- Amaya and Aunt Eskama eat together and hang out. Amaya bravely asks about what happened all those years ago. 
		- [x] {Does Aunt Eskama open up?} MUNE > Unlikely: No, and 
			- Aunt Eskama says it's too early to ask. And to make up for her silence, she gives you a gift from the museum shop. 
			- [x] {What does she give you?} Iron Valley flea market > 60 > Music box [Literally what is she meant to do with this lol]
			- The gift is a Pink Flute. [Added to inventory] Amaya does NOT know how to play this, but she can use it to call animals since Eskama has arranged for her a meet and greet of people she could work with while she lives in Aurora. Times are tough. Everyone works to help each other out and make sure everyone is fed. 
			- **Make a Promise**: [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Player Characters/MSFY-Promise Tracker-Amaya#Decide how to help the community through work (2)\|MSFY-Promise Tracker-Amaya#Decide how to help the community through work (2)]] so first you need to meet with one or more of the following: 
				- Vet 
				- Wildlife Rescue
				- Rancher
				- Pigeon Keeper
			- [Still have 2/4 time left for the day, so I should go do more things!!! Maybe meet up with one of the townies that Amaya can shadow... But I'm going to take a break for now!!! Spent a lot of time double-checking rules, but this was so fun so far!!!!]

## Reflection 

First reflection was during the 1st play session: 
![[#^87f2c6]]

The Enemies to Lovers thing is kinda promising at the moment, except for Amaya's people-pleaser doormat tendencies... Hmmm... Stay tuned.
