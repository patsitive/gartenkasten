### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

## Reflection 

The Enemies to Lovers thing is kinda promising at the moment, except for Amaya's people-pleaser doormat tendencies... Hmmm... Stay tuned. 

Also, I appreciate that I can play for a bit, do something else, then come back two days later haha.
