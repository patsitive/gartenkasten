## Plot synopsis 

Tender-hearted Amaya is burnt out and tired. Always putting people first, her fear of losing people has pushed her to the limit. It's time to face the past to stop it from repeating. Maybe it's time to accept that invitation to stay with her estranged Aunt. 

{Love Interest} is down on {LI pronoun} luck and homeless after a freak landslide by the old mine wrecked {LI pronoun} home. Everyone is struggling in Aurora. But luckily {Aunt} has opened up her home. In Aurora, they always pay it forward. That's exactly what {Love Interest} is going to do. 

Some ideas: 
- enemies to lovers
- forced proximity 
- small town romance 
- MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE?

### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

System: 
- [Iron Valley by M Kirin](https://mkirin.itch.io/iron-valley)

> Entry worked on: 
> - [[Slices/2025-09-25\|2025-09-25]]
### Events 

- Confirmed I'm not a bigot, so I am allowed to play ✨
- Rulebook + player sheet + virtual dice = ✔️

- World truths? 
	- Set in the same game universe as [[Learn in Public/Play/Tea Time with Your Orc Lover\|Tea Time with Your Orc Lover]]
	- Name of Iron Valley?
		- [`d4 = 3` + `d12 = 4` => Refresh options 3x then pick from 4th entry on [Random address in Philippines](https://www.bestrandoms.com/random-address-in-ph?quantity=10)]
		- Decided to pick one from entry 3 instead lol
		- Aurora 
		- Aurora (Iron Valley) is a small town in disrepair 
	- More worldbuilding here: [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/TTYOL Worldbuilding\|TTYOL Worldbuilding]]

- Character truths for [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Character-Amaya\|Amaya]]
	- I decided that this character has the following:
		- Pronouns: She / Her 
		- Gender Presentation: feminine
	- Character name?
		- Rolled from [Filipino name generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/filipino-names.php)
		- Picked **Amaya**
		- No last name as per Iron Valley convention 
	- Birthday? 
		- Iron Valley date oracle: [| 37  | Summer                  | 12  |]
		- Summer 12
	- Why did you leave the big city? 
		- Estranged aunt has invited you to stay with her. It's been years since your whole family lived in Aurora together... before mum and aunt had that big fight...
	- When are you arriving in Aurora? 
		- Iron Valley date oracle: [| 30  | Summer                  | 5   |]
		- Summer 5 (OMG that's exciting, in-game birthday is coming up soon)
	- Where are you staying in town?
		- In Aunt's house (Amaya doesn't know that there's someone else there too?!)
	- How long do you plan to stay? 
		- 1 year, maybe (She's not sure if she'll want to return home)
	- What's in your backpack? 
		- Rolls 3x from Iron Valley random item oracle
			- [Eek — I lost the numbers, but I noted which items to pick from below]
			- Picked: 
				- Tin of mints — Amaya would rather die than have bad breath 
				- Sturdy work boots — Mum heard that Aurora has 'gone to the dogs' so insisted on the boots
				- First aid kit — If it's that bad, then a first aid kit makes sense too... just in case 

| Edible | Wearable | Sentimental and Practical | Magical, Silly, and Fun | Random! | More Random! |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Tin of mints     | Warm hat          | Soup tureen that looks like a chicken               | Waffle maker that makes heart-shaped waffles | A pacifier                     | Old Newspaper of the day when it happened |
| Fancy Jam/Jelly  | Woolen socks      | Handmade Plush Animal (Low Quality, but still cute) | Pot of invisible ink                         | A binder full of trading cards | First Aid Kit                             | 
| Fancy chef salts | Sturdy work boots | Instant Camera with film                            | Rose that never wilts                        | A creepy doll                  | Homemade scarf                            |

- What are Amaya's strengths and weaknesses? 
	- Stat values allowed: [3, 2, 2, 1, 1] 
	- Heart: 2 — That fight between Mum and her Aunt really shook her up. She's scared of ruining relationships and treads carefully; she wants people to be happy. 
	- Iron: 2 — Dad treated Amaya like a son, in that as his eldest child she was the strong pair of hands he could count on. 
	- Shadow: 1 — Amaya is pretty straight-laced and very much unmagical 
	- Wits: 3 — Thinking things through has never let her down. Except, when she overthinks and doesn't act and that leads to problems, but Amaya doesn't think about that. Much. Well, tries not to.
	- Edge: 1 — Could Amaya outrun someone? Hmm, maybe not. 

- What skills might help Amaya in Aurora? 
	- [I am going to pick from the skills and not randomise this!!!]
	- First Aid — Amaya never wanted people to know if she got hurt, so she got really good at patching herself up. 
	- Inquire — As an overthinker _and_ people pleaser, Amaya has learned the art of asking in a way that people _want_ to answer. This is the upgraded skill. 
	- Creature handling — While Dad specialised in caring for holy pigeons, there was no shortage of animals needing help in the city. She knows exactly how to lift safely and strongly. The best part? Animals love unconditionally. 
	- [Amaya is going to need to get satisfaction fast because she will need to repair the house ahahaha, ahhh this entertains me]

- What are Amaya's starting promises? These relate to: 
	- Game setting — Find out what caused Aurora to get so rundown (6 boxes)
	- Reason you're moving to Aurora 
		- [Uhhh... Amaya knew about the invitation 3 years ago. So I need to think about why she's moving _now_]
		- Tarot card pull: [![Resources/Decks/Tarot/09-TheHermit.png|srt-flip2](/img/user/Learn%20in%20Public/Play/Resources/Decks/Tarot/09-TheHermit.png)]
		- [OMG THIS IS SO FITTING!!!! ]
		- [Reversed hermit meaning](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/the-hermit-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings?srsltid=AfmBOoqsnKoh6AfdoZpqXIyJTuUwqokfXbJdjICa4JMdLnPvLeUddQ6q): "When it comes to work, the hermit reversal meaning refers to your preparedness to get to the bottom of something that has been troubling you for quite some time now. There is searching to be done, and it will be your responsibility to ask the question that will allow the other people to understand the circumstances."
		- Amaya is burnout. Too many expectations and too many things to do. But she's scared of something happening — like with Mum and Aunt — and of that happening to _her_. But she's so tired. And maybe if she figures out just what happened years ago when her Mum vowed her Aunt was dead to them — well, maybe, she could stop it happening to her... and maybe reunite her family. Her sisters refused to come; her Mum got so mad, but Dad said he's proud of her. That's something. 
		- [Originally, Aunt was dead, and she inherited the house. But I'm kind of sick of the dead relative trope lol. And I wanted the hopefulness of a possible reconciliation and how emotionally fraught that can be—like you want it so much, but you're scared it will cost you. But maybe it's worth the risk.]
		- Figure out why Mum and Aunt fought and make peace with their history (8 boxes)
	- Where you're staying — Fix up Aunt's old house (5 boxes)


### Reflection 

Okay, this is surprisingly emotional? Not sure how this happened, but I'm vibing with it, although the themes are hitting kinda close to home 🫠😂 

	- Me: I just want a cosy, small town romance
	- Also Me: But make everyone traumatised 

I WILL KEEP THIS COSY. LIKE, OKAY, FEELINGS, BUT GOOD VIBES. LESHGOOOOO.
