## Start Here 

Much like a cottage garden, this digital space is messy, magical, and you never know what will pop up next. 

> [!tip] Curious about **what even is this**? 
> Please start with one of these questions
> - What is a [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1A3) Digital garden\|(1A1A1A3) Digital garden]]?
> - What is a [[Learn in Public/Think/Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]]?
> - Why do I say [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden\|(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden]]?
> - What are the [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A41) Note types in MY zettelkasten\|(1A41) Note types in MY zettelkasten]]? 
> - [[How to navigate the gartenkasten\|How to navigate the gartenkasten]]? 

**As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts.** 

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or lifeâ€”and cultivate it, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

### Types of links

> _By the way..._ 
> - **[[pink links\|pink links]]** either mean that the note is _unpublished_ or _private_ 
> - _[arrowed links](http://google.com)_ go elsewhere on the internet
> - **[[Learn in Public/Welcome to Pat's gartenkasten\|green links]]** are my own publicly published notes or pages (yes, you can view them). 

> [!question]- I want to know what's in that private note!!!! 
> Ohhhh, you like knowing hidden things, hey? Drop me a [[Learn in Public/Start Here#Want to hang out? ðŸŒ¿\|note]], and I'll see if I'm happy to share by emailing you the contents, publishing it, or bursting your bubble by saying 'sorry, that's just a placeholderâ€”my bad'.
### Topics I like to explore

I love to collect hobbies, and I love to learn new things. So my gartenkasten is going to have random things in it. 

Here are some things I hope it will contain: 
- Identity
- Self-narratives
- Professional coaching 
- Systems thinking
- Mental health 
- Whimsy and cosiness as antidote to hustle culture 
- Gamification 
- Woowoo
- Language
- Reflections on stuff I've written or made 
- ...anything else that tickles my fancy!
