# Keshav (2007) How to Read a Paper

>[!tldr]+ Summary
> Paper explains how to complete a **three-pass read** of research papers. 
>

> [!info] Reference 
> Reference:: Keshav, S. (2007). How to Read a Paper. _ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review_, _37_(3), 83â€“84. [https://doi.org/10.1145/1273445.127345](https://doi.org/10.1145/1273445.127345)

## Key Points 

### Reading Process

- First pass - quick scan (5-10 mins) 
	- Read: title, abstract, introductions, headings and sub-headings, conclusion, references (esp. known ones)
	- Can answer 5 C's
		- Category - type? analysis, review, overview, etc
		- Context - what does it relate to? papers? models? 
		- Correctness - is what it's saying valid?
		- Clarity - is it well-written?
	- Decide if you want to complete 2nd and 3rd pass. 
	- Sufficient for papers outside field. 
- Second pass - the highlight pass (up to 60 mins)
	- visuals: figures, diagrams, illustrations - check for mistakes
	- references- for future reading 
	- Can summarise main points with supporting evidence
- Third pass (4-5 hours for beginners, ~1 hour for experts) - the Zettelkasten part 
	- Using author's assumptions, recreate the work 
	- identify and challenge assertions - how would you state this? 
	- note own ideas for future work 
	- Can elaborate on paper in its entirety and highlight its strong and weak points, underlying assumptions, potential issues. 
- **Literature Survey** 
	- Google Scholar - use keywords 
		- one pass for 3-5 papers 
		- related works (shared citations + repeated authors)
		- download important related works 
		- identify conferences and and journals that repeated authors published in 
		- download recent works 
		- make 2 passes through these papers 
	- if lucky: recent survey paper or meta-analysis

## Reaction 
> [!tip] Reaction 
> I thought this was a helpful way to approach reading academic articles. I really like that it had a common-sense approach and also highlighted other papers to improve ones ability to review or write. Again, relating to [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A) Writers are made through writing and reading\|(1A) Writers are made through writing and reading]]]. 
> Very applicable to the [**example**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1D1A) Flow of zettelkasten\|(1A1D1A) Flow of zettelkasten]]], especially with respect to pass 2 and 3.
