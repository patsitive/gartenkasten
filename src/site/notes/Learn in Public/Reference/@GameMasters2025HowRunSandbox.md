Simplify game setup with these techniques to create a sandbox with near unlimited possibilities. The video talks about these techniques in the context of Game Master preparation for group ttrpg games, but I think the techniques can be adapted for solo RPGs â€” these essentially utilise constraints to generate creativity, which support emergent narrative.

### Techniques I want to use for solo roleplay
There were three more techniques, but I opted not to take notes on them. ðŸ˜…

This video has inspired me so much that I did more prep-setting for [[Learn in Public/Play/Making Space for You\|Making Space for You]] which I detail here: [[Learn in Public/Play/Actual Plays/Making Space For You/MSFY-000a Creating a sandbox\|MSFY-000a Creating a sandbox]]

#### Situation, NOT Story

Instead of preparing a story in advance, concoct situations for players and characters to respond to. 

> [!tip] Compelling situation = **Location + Conflict + Motivated characters** (PC & NPC)

For solo roleplay, this may mean fleshing out NPCs more, but I think this will combine well with [[#NPC Triangle]] and [[#5x5]]

#### NPC Triangle 

Create tension and conflict by having 3 different NPCs with opposing motivations and desires. Interacting with the NPCs reveal the underlying tension and help shape the narrative. 

#### 5x5


#### Yes... BUT! 


#### Clockwork
