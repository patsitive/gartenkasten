Simplify game setup with these techniques to create a sandbox with near unlimited possibilities. The video talks about these techniques in the context of Game Master preparation for group ttrpg games, but I think the techniques can be adapted for solo RPGs â€” these essentially utilise constraints to generate creativity, which support emergent narrative.

### Techniques I want to use for solo roleplay
There were three more techniques, but I opted not to take notes on them. ðŸ˜…

This video has inspired me so much that I did more prep-setting for [[Learn in Public/Play/Making Space for You\|Making Space for You]] which I detail here: [[Learn in Public/Play/Actual Plays/MSFY-000a Creating a sandbox\|MSFY-000a Creating a sandbox]]

#### Situation, NOT Story

Instead of preparing a story in advance, concoct situations for players and characters to respond to. 

> [!tip] Compelling situation = **Location + Conflict + Motivated characters** (PC & NPC)

For solo roleplay, this may mean fleshing out NPCs more, but I think this will combine well with [[#NPC Triangle]] and [[#5x5]]

#### NPC Triangle 

Create tension and conflict by having 3 different NPCs with opposing motivations and desires. Interacting with the NPCs reveal the underlying tension and help shape the narrative. 

As at [[Slices/2025-09-25\|2025-09-25]], I am toying with this idea in the [[Learn in Public/Play/Making Space for You\|Making Space for You]] adventure: 
- [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/TTYOL NPCs#Makisig (Dwarf)\|Makisig]] wants to reopen the closed down mine.
- [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/TTYOL NPCs#Eskama (Human Aunt)\|Aunt Eskama]] is supporting [[Learn in Public/Play/Resources/Character-Amaya\|Amaya's]] as-yet unnamed love interest to petition the government to pay reparations for previous handling of mine that has contributed to the landslide that killed love interest's family and wrecked said love interest's home 
- ??? needs a third conflicting motivation hmmm
#### 5x5


#### Yes... BUT! 


#### Clockwork 


#### Reskin
