Notes on running hacking scenarios or actions with the Savage Worlds setting. Took these to extrapolate ideas for roleplaying a hacker in general, since that is what I am doing in [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Blades Cyberpunk\|Blades Cyberpunk]]...! 💗

- 3 steps to hacking 
	- gain access to the system
	- retrieve info on the system or execute program
	- exit the system (cover your tracks)
- gain access to the system 
	- Knowing more about the system itself and practices relating to the system — cleaning data once a month, where the server is located, etc
	- networking to gather information — social engineering, intimidate to get password
- retrieve info
	- For actually getting the info, possibly use research or similar to go through the info and find what you need 
- execute program 
	- not mentioned in video: but it would make sense to make the program or executable prior to doing the hacking. Or maybe you get the info then make a program after based on what you got. 
- exit the system 
	- erase logs, reset passwords, etc. Hide the fact that you were ever in the system 
	- prevents future consequences (e.g. your actions aren't traced back to you)
