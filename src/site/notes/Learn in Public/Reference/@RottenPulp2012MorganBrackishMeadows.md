I was reading about dungeon re-stocking, and as always I opened so many links. This was one that I opened, and I found it really interesting! 

> Reference: **[Rotten Pulp (2012). Morgan Brackish Meadows' Anti-Hammerspace Item Tracker](http://rottenpulp.blogspot.com/2012/06/anti-hammerspace-item.html)**

Argues that space-/container- based item tracking as opposed to weight-based encumbrance can feel more realistic while also being easier to follow. [^1]

To use this, each player gets the equivalent of six containers based on their character design or attire. Each container has 3 slots. An item will use 1 or more slots in a container. [^2]

In addition to tracking the item slots, the sheet also has you note: 
- Coins and gems (where 1000 coins = 1 slot) 
- Light items [^3] [^4]
- Things you are wearing 
- In storage (not on your person but in a secure location)
- List of items you want to obtain (handy reminder!)

[^1]: I would argue that this method is compatible with weight-based encumbrance systems like in Worlds Without Number and also something like the Loadout for narrative games like Runners in the Shadows. In the former, you could calculate that the total weight of items in the Anti-Hammerspace Item Tracker does not exceed your encumbrance limit. For the latter, you could ensure that the slots of your items do not exceed the loadout limit. 
[^2]: While the article did not state this, in theory, you could reduce the number of container but increase the number of slots within. The total slots will still be the same. 
[^3]: Personally, I think that light items should be noted within slots (Maybe they occupy the same slot or they are haphazardly stashed next to items because in the fiction it would make sense for them go *somewhere*. 
[^4]: Also, you could combine this with the rule in [[2d6 Dungeons\|2d6 Dungeons]] that says that where it makes sense small items should be contained in vials, pouches, etc. to avoid contamination or damage.
