# @BanditsKeep2024HowUseRumors

>[!tldr]+ Summary
> My notes and additional thoughts on a video about using rumours effectively in a TTRPG-setting. The video talks about rumours for a DM/GM running a D&D group, but I think it can work for solo roleplay and story-writing too.

These are my personal notes and reflections based on the reference source noted above. 💗 My insights may differ from what originally intended by the original author.

## Key Points
A rumour in a ttrpg feeds information to players that provides flavour and directs behaviour towards adventure. 

Types of rumours 

Tavern talk - news, what people gossip about 
Legends - folk tales that players can learn more about from NPCs (e.g. discover something related then ask around about it)
Superstition - beliefs about something ongoing and unknown 

Introducing rumours 
- learn about rumours passively (e.g. overhear in a tavern, written on a noticeboard)
	- Did you hear the Prince is getting married?
	- I saw smoke up north-- what do you think that is?
- interact with an object, location, or rumour (e.g. inscription on a helmet that was loot, page from a book while researching, warning mentioned, etc.) 
- characters seek out more information about a rumour (e.g. from guilds, merchants, local tavern, sages, library)
- characters exchange stories with others (e.g. commented in response while travelling)
	- You're heading to the cove at this hour? No one ever come back if they do. Wait until the morning to travel there.
	- There's a merchant caravan up the ways you're headed 
	- Oh really? We were told to never mix black moss with crystal shards.
	- Sorry, stranger! I'm in a rush. King's Guard is coming, and I heard they are looking for new guardsmen. 
- characters already know these (e.g. as part of backstory, lore of the world)

Framing rumours 
- give some rumours to some characters to already know 
- elaborate narratively on how characters (player or non-player) came across rumours 
- share rumours with variations (different tidbits, different interpretations, similar motifs)

I think the concept of rumours is so good! I think, in addition to group ttrpg, it also has applicability for solo roleplaying as well as for story-writing. Excited to use this in my games.
