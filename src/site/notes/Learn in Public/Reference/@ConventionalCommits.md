## Key Points
- Standardise commit messages to make life easier 
	- Easy to maintain good CHANGELOGS: commit messages clearly define what has changed
		- [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) 
	- Communicates change clearly and makes it easier for people to understand and adapt 
	- If people know and understand what you/other have done, they can more easily identify how they can help 
- Idea: Could use 'commit messages' in daily life to track changes and progress? Maybe connected to [[Learn in Public/Think/Interstitial Journaling\|Interstitial Journaling]] 
- Most important part: state 'type' of change
	- main
		- fix: — patch a bug 
		- feat: — add new feature 
		- docs: — update docs 
	- other
		- chore: 
		- refactor:
		- perf: (I don't know what this means?!)
		- style: 
		- improvement: 
		- test: 

### Commit Convention

This seems like a sensible approach, and I think I will adopt it for my projects. Seems like it will make my debugging much easier!
