These are my personal notes and reflections based on the reference source noted above. ðŸ’— My insights may differ from what originally intended by the original author.

## Key Points
- Logistics of playing and creating Actual Plays
	- Share your actual plays somewhere people can subscribe because it pushes your work to those who want to see it. 
	- Create a backlog before you start releasing (**ðŸ’­ Commentary:**  Argh, oops. I failed that.)
	- Create a production schedule you can stick to. 
	- Croaker noted some tools that other roleplayers have used: e.g. Miro, Google Keep, Notion, Roll20, etc. 
	- Interesting: [Write Firster of Playing With Myself](https://playingwithmyself.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile) also enjoys playing solo ttrpg on mobile! 
- Telling stories 
	- Plan an overarching narrative, to put oracle rolls into context. 
	- Write out the story
	- Showcase the mechanics of the game (and visually distinguish from the story)
