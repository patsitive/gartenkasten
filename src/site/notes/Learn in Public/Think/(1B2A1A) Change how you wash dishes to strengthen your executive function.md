People say washing dishes is easy. Maybe it is for some people. For others, it's an overwhelming mountain. For others still, it depends on the day–depends on the spoons. 

I argue that no matter how "easy" a task is, [**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/If a task isn't getting done, it isn't 'ease-y' enough\|If a task isn't getting done, it isn't 'ease-y' enough]]]. 

How do you make it easier? 

- system: put like objects together for easier washing and drying
- sensory: gloves to fend off the slimy feeling
- fun: 15 minute music playlist that you must defeat 
- skip: on bad mental health days, skip the dishes–use paper plates

Keep tinkering until it's so easy, it's near impossible to *not* do it. 

Then you'll be sure it's easy enough.
