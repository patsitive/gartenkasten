Writing a body paragraph in an essay is a matter of arranging and rearranging [**Prev**::[[Learn in Public/Think/Elements of information\|Elements of information]]] to argue a point. 

After all, according to [**source**:: [[Learn in Public/Reference/@Chapman2025AdvancedWritingCoursera\|@Chapman2025AdvancedWritingCoursera]]], although body paragraphs (or modes of discourse) may serve different purposes, they largely follow the same structure: 
- Topic or thesis statement
- Supporting ideas 
- Details 
- Conclusion or transition sentence.

The different elements of information are arranged and articulated in slightly different ways, depending on the type or purpose of the paragraph, which [**source**:: [[Learn in Public/Reference/@Chapman2025AdvancedWritingCoursera\|@Chapman2025AdvancedWritingCoursera]]] listed as follows: 
- Cause / Effect — why something happens 
- Compare / Contrast — similarities and differences 
- Argument — arguing for or against something (not described by Chapman, I'm assuming...)
	- PEECEL - while this structure was not mentioned by Chapman, this structure would fit arguing a position
- Classification
- Illustration / Exemplification — shows or illustrates by examples 
- Sequential paragraphs 
	- Description — geographic or spatial description of the topic 
	- Narration — story and time transitions 
	- Process — step by step
