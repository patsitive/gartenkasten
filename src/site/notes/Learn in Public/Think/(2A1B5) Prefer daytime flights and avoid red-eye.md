So I have previously decided that [**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(2A1B) I Need To Treat Myself Like A Sim\|(2A1B) I Need To Treat Myself Like A Sim]]], which mostly relates to working hard to stay aware of my internal 'stats', but I could also think about it as applying rules for living (e.g. do not allow your Sim to run out of counter space lest they place their grilled cheese on the floor and starve to deathâ€”which I vaguely remember being a bug in Sims 2...). 

New rule for myself: stick to daytime or regular flights

Yes, red-eye can be significantly cheaper. Yes, in theory, you go about your day, then sleep on the plane, then carry on with your new day.  

But my body clock and executive function require careful calibration. One red-eye flight later, and I have lost four days to sleep and emotional dysregulation. No more red-eye flights.
