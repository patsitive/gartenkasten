### What are visual keys for solo ttrpg Actual Play logs 

Visual keys are visual + textual cues that communicate the meaning of text. 

In my gameplay, I use a combination of callouts, bullet point levels and emojis.

## Why should you include a visual key in your Actual Play logs? 

I include legends in my roleplay logs for many reasons! 

[[Roleplay log keys for Actual Plays make logs accessible\|Roleplay log keys for Actual Plays make logs accessible]]

To summarise, visual keys benefit myself as a roleplayer as well as any potential readers/listeners/viewers. The keys help me quickly access my own information and also make my games easier to access for people of varied preferences and/or needs. 

My visual keys are a work-in-progress, and it's the same thing with my general accessibility practice. I'm committed _and_ learning _and_ growing all the time. ðŸ’—

So, maybe it's time to include a visual key in your solo ttrpg actual play logs? Food for thought! ðŸ§
