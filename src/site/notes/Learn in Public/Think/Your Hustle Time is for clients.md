Monaco[^Pricing] says, "Your hustle is either seeing clients or hustling to find clients". During your hustle hours, you're doing the work that pays the bills - i.e., you are literally getting paid in the moment for this work. 

For example, if you are doing a client's manicure, that's part of your hustle. 

The only time your hustle includes finding clients is when there are no clients to see during that time. 

Yes! This does mean that you don't include your admin, marketing, etc hours. That's working on your business and [[Working on Your Business is sacred time\|Working on Your Business is sacred time]]

Note: if you have employees, hustle hours are the total number of hours available to see clients.
