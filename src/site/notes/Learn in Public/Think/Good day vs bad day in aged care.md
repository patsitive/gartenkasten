Observation: when asked, an elderly person doesn't know what wishes they have. So then you try and ask, "Well, what's the difference between a good day and a bad day?"*

The open-ended question of the former may stump someone who isn't used to being asked such questions. But being asked about your days is more concrete. It focuses your attention on something 'real' which makes it easier to answer.

Relevant here because you need to ask the right question for the person to be able to come up with an answer. Although asking about wishes is a great tool, if it doesn't work for someone, then you need to pivot.
