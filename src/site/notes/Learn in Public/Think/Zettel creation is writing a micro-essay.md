In my practice, writing a zettel is like writing a micro-essay, insofar as the mechanics are the same: [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1C1) Read like a detective\|you start by reading]]], [**supports**:: [[Refactoring reflects ongoing progress\|you reflect and synthesise]]], then you [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Writing depends on your ability to read\|express that thinking]]] as the [**example**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A4) Zettel as micro-essay\|complete zettel]]]. In this manner, [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A3) We act out our identity\|(1A3) We act out our identity]]] as [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Writers are made through writing and reading\|Writers are made through writing and reading]]]. Therefore, [**north**:: [[Creation is recursive\|Creation is recursive]]].

[**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Act of zettelkasten is associative in thinking\|Act of zettelkasten is associative in thinking]]], which, I suppose, is why they say you can string a number of zettels together to create a finished piece of work. It is also how I can argue that [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/My daily actions and thoughts cultivate my garden of identity\|My daily actions and thoughts cultivate my garden of identity]]]: this process reinforces that I already am a writer, one who [**supports**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A3A) Shift your identity by changing your actions\|continues to evolve]]].
