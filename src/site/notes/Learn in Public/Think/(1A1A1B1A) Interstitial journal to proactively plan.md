In keeping an [**Parent**:: [[Interstitial Journaling\|Interstitial Journaling]]] practice, one keeps a running record of daily life by recording logs that state the __current time__ and **description**. 

I initially believed that this definition meant that interstitial journaling can only be used retrospectively: to log what has already happened.

It turns out interstitial journaling can also be used proactively to reflect on your goals, plans and strategies before jumping into upcoming activities ([**source**:: [[Learn in Public/Reference/@TheLydiaToddPod2024InterstitialJournalingIncrease\|@TheLydiaToddPod]]].) 

> Another log in your journal might state: 
> - `- 10:15 - Finished my break. Time to work on essay prep` or 
> - `- 10:15 - Essay prep time. Need to check marking rubric, pull relevant ideas from zettelkasten, assemble into rough essay plan`.

After all, central to interstitial journaling is the capture of the passage of time. It records snapshots of life through timestamped logs.

If recording the passage of time is what's most important to interstitial journaling, then it is sensible to record past, current and future activities because that is how we experience time. Logs recording the recent past (or less recent if you're bad at recording like me) anchor what has happened; logs can detail your present thoughts and actions; entries can also reflect on what is to come. All have a purpose: record of experiences, anchor for mindfulness, or guide for focus, respectively, as you experience [**contributes to**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1B1B) Interstitial Journaling Orients You To Both Event & Clock Time\|(1A1A1B1B) Interstitial Journaling Orients You To Both Event & Clock Time]]].
