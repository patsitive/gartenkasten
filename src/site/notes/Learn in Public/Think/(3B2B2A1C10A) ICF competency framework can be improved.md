The [[Learn in Public/Think/(3B2B2A1C10) ICF Core Competencies as at 2019\|(3B2B2A1C10) ICF Core Competencies as at 2019]] make sense, especially since these were developed based on research from a global study of professional coaches. These line up with what you would expect from coaching principles and from my personal experience as a coach and coachee. Although I am not ICF-credentialed, I refer to and use these competencies myself. 

In other words, I think this is a great start that can be improved upon. 

As an HR practitioner, I think that while it does give a sense of what 'good looks like', I am more used to competency and capability frameworks listing levels (Thinking back to working on a capability framework for one of the largest Ministries in New Zealand). 

As noted by [**source**:: [[Learn in Public/Reference/@greenECampusOntarioOpenCompetency2021\|@greenECampusOntarioOpenCompetency2021]]], the journey to competence unfolds over time and progresses non-linearly. When the competency framework can describe expectations according to levels of proficiency, this scaffold in an expectation of growth and development.
