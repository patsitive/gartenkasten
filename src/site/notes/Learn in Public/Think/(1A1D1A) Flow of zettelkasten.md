According to [**source**:: [[Learn in Public/Reference/@zhaoCompassZettelkastenThinking\|@zhaoCompassZettelkastenThinking]]], this goes from:
> Input > Digest > Organise > Outline / Output 

- Where: 
	- Input = fleeting notes and literature notes 
	- Digest = idea note (permanent note / zettel / thought note)
	- Organise = file the idea (e.g. folgezettel according to Bob Doto)
	- Outline / Output = reuse the idea
