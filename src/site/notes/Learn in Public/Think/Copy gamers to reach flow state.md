see: that book about game design on Kindle 

Gaming hastens flow state because it creates optimal flow conditions: namely, intrinsic reward (fun), just right challenge (optimal and scales according to ability), immediate feedback, sense of control, etc.

Isn't it kinda annoying that gamers can get lost in flow state for hours playing video games, but you try and read a book for 15 minutes and you can't do it? 

It's because games are designed to create flow. 

One way you can make something more flow-friendly is to make it intrinsically rewarding - aka make it fun! 

So if we're trying to read an economics textbook, pretend you scammed your way into being the Minister of Finance and you need to hide the fact you don't know what you're doing by reading this book. There's also the skittle method where eat a skittle every paragraph. 

What's something you can try to make things more fun?
