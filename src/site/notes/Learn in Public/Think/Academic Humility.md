Academic humility is having the openness of mind that anyone and any source you should encounter may offer you something new - new insight, new wisdom, new idea. 

originally heard this from [**source**:: [[morganuea\|morganuea]]] when she cited [**source**:: [[Eco1977HowWriteThesis\|Eco1977HowWriteThesis]]] (which I need to continue reading) - "Knowledge that anyone can teach us something" 

I think this also ties into [[Unconditional Positive Regard\|Unconditional Positive Regard]] because you must be willing to see the good in others. 'Acceptance without bias'
