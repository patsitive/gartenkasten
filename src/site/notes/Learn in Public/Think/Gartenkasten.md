Gartenkasten is my whimsical portmanteau of these two thinking and writing models! 
> - '**[[Learn in Public/Think/Digital garden\|Digital garden]]**' (`garten`) â€” where ideas are expected to evolve and interconnect 
> - '[[Learn in Public/Think/Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]]' (`slip/note box`) â€” where ideas are atomic and branching off each other 

(Notice how the term is Germanâ€”and I _don't_ speak itâ€”so I've skipped the 'digital' part ğŸ˜… German, I love you for your elegant modularity ğŸ’•)

**Why make a new term?**
