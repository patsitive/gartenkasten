I am observing that of the 30+ articles I've engaged with as part of my [[Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching\|Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching]] that the reference density (how often and how many times a journal articles cites preceding work) varies a lot. Some feel a lot more sparse in citations. I'm unsure if this is because the papers are assuming a lot of what they're stating is common knowledge; however, I thought best practice is to cite as much as possible. 

This has gotten me hyped to do a research project...! [[Patterns, Pathways, and Power-Bibliometric analysis of the citation practices shaping the field of professional coaching (1970-2020)\|Patterns, Pathways, and Power-Bibliometric analysis of the citation practices shaping the field of professional coaching (1970-2020)]]
