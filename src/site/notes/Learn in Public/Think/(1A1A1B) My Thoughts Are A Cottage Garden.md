[[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort\|(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort]], and my public notes represent a cottage garden of thoughts and musings-- with lots of beauty and chaos. 

As a cottage or kitchen garden, it needs to be a 'working garden' that bears fruit. I use [[Learn in Public/Think/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management]] and [[Resources/Zettelkasten Process\|Zettelkasten Process]] to develop my thinking and hopefully bear fruit in the form of writing, visuals and videos.
