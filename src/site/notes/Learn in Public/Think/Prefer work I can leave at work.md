If I can help it, I want a job where I leave my work at the office. 

That is, nobody is going to call me up in the middle of the night about work. 

Examples
- [**example**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/I suit nursing\|I suit nursing]]]

Anti-examples 
- Manager 
- [**opposes**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/I suit Social Work\|I suit Social Work]]]
