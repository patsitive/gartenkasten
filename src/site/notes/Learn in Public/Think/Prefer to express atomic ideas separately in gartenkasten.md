My gartenkasten goal is to [**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Digital gardens are not blogs\|tend to my ideas]]], so that they are atomic: expressed clearly and concisely. Multiple, short notes expressing atomic ideas are preferred over lengthy, complicated notes—except where I have intentionally reflected on a specific topic/ argument. Brevity trims the superfluous, so the words that remain can better explain or be understood. 

Include only what is essential in your writing [[Learn in Public/Reference/@Bolton2014InspirationalWritingAcademic\|@Bolton2014InspirationalWritingAcademic]]

This is obviously too long. Lol 😆 Ironic.
