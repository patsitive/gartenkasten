A scene can reconnect us to a specific emotion by depicting the details that sparked the emotion itself â€” good or bad ([[Learn in Public/Reference/@greiss7TipsDocument2025\|@greiss7TipsDocument2025]]). One example was to depict happiness by showing a sunny day. 

This idea was for video-editing but could definitely apply to writing!

My thinking: 
- messy desk can allude to scattered thinking or anxious feelings 
- sounds of birds chirping can remind me of the joy of going on a backyard picnic 
- scuffed up shoes by the door = hike from earlier that day
