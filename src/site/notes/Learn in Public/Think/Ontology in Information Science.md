In [[Information Science\|Information Science]], an ontology formally defines the conceptual conventions of entities: their properties and relationships to each other ([[Learn in Public/Reference/@guarinoWhatOntology2003\|@guarinoWhatOntology2003]]). An ontology answers the questions "what is this?" "what is it like?" and "how does it connect to other entities?" 

**example**:: [[Resources/Defining Personal Ontology\|Defining Personal Ontology]]

``` BibTex
@book{book,
author = {Staab, Steffen and Studer, Rudi},
year = {2003},
month = {01},
pages = {},
title = {Handbook on Ontologies},
isbn = {978-3540408345},
doi = {10.1007/978-3-540-92673-3}
}
```

I thin, the above reference can be considered an example of an ontological expression? In BibTex, a book is defined as an entity with the properties of author, year, etc. Relationships to other books can be expressed using these properties. What other books have Staab and Studer authored? What other books were published in the same year? 

Elaborating on ontology or requiring [[Learn in Public/Think/Prefer semantic links between notes\|semantic links]] supports the practice of [**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]]].
