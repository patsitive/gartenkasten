I was trained in [[Learn in Public/Think/Coaching\|Coaching]] methodology at the Ministry of Social Development in New Zealand. I also learned through reflective practice when I coached staff in the moment (like how [[Learn in Public/Think/(3B7B) Gallwey Observed That Asking Questions Helped Athletes Solidify Adjustments Compared To Cueing Them\|(3B7B) Gallwey Observed That Asking Questions Helped Athletes Solidify Adjustments Compared To Cueing Them]]) or in formalised coaching sessions as well as in a reflective practice group, which was so handy during the COVID 2020 pandemic. 

I am formalising my theoretical understanding via [[Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching\|Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching]]:
