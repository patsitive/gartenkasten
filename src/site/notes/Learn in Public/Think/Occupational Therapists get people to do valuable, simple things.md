Occupational Therapists identify the best interventions for a patient, taking into consideration their needs and situation. Since the goal is to help people live life successfully, OTs need to provide value through these interventions. 

So the OT needs to: 
1. identify appropriate interventions 
2. collaborate on a plan with the patient 
3. successfully get the patient to follow through with plan 
4. see improvement in patient's situation 
## I probably need citations for previous paragraphs. I think I've read it SOMEWHERE or listened to it somewhere, but where exactly lol. 

Sometimes these interventions seem simple, as per [[Learn in Public/Reference/Tools for Practice in Occupational Therapy (2000) - Hagedorn, Rosemary\|Tools for Practice in Occupational Therapy (2000) - Hagedorn, Rosemary]]

Simple can mean improved adherence. (I know this from somewhere but WHERE?) 
Simple can mean that [[Occupational Therapy is low tech\|Occupational Therapy is low tech]].
Simple can refer to grouping and communication, e.g. [[Learn in Public/Think/(2A1B4) RAMPS Is A Simple Way To Explain OT Interventions\|(2A1B4) RAMPS Is A Simple Way To Explain OT Interventions]]
