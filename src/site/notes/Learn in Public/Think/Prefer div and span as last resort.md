`<div>` and `<span>` [**Prev**:: [[HTML tag use should convey meaning\|don't provide any benefits]]] other than saying "this content belongs together" and whether it should be displayed inline or block. 

Both functions can be achieved through [**example**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/HTML tag hierarchy\|custom html tags]]] with the added benefit that these are human-readable. 

In other words, I support [replacing divs with custom elements](https://matthewjamestaylor.com/div-custom-elements).
