I am motivated to become an Occupational Therapist because of its model of using practical interventions to create lasting, impactful change. 

I see OT as a very practical-focussed therapy that is useful for complicated situations. While [[Occupational Therapy is low tech\|Occupational Therapy is low tech]] or sometimes appears to be "just common sense", [[Learn in Public/Think/Occupational Therapists get people to do valuable, simple things\|Occupational Therapists get people to do valuable, simple things]]. The rationale behind the specific interventions chosen are complex and tailored to the needs of the individual. Providing people the support needed to regain (or gain for the first time) the independence and ability to do 'occupational tasks', which really are about being able to LIVE your life, would be incredible. I watched my brother go from non-verbal to fully fluent in English through Occupational Therapy. I know OT can help people with disability, mental health, stroke, etc.
