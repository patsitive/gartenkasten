Working within your zettelkasten, you are thinking about associations to other thoughts or notes. The folgezettel is one way to track associations. [[Learn in Public/Think/Compass of Thoughts can generate ideas or connections\|Compass of Thoughts can generate ideas or connections]] and is another way of thinking associatively. 

For example: 
[[Learn in Public/Think/I am a writer\|I am a writer]] is related to [[Learn in Public/Think/Writers are made through writing and reading\|Writers are made through writing and reading]] - 1A branched from 1 through folgezettel 
[[Learn in Public/Think/I am a writer\|I am a writer]] also relates to [[Learn in Public/Think/(2A1B2B) People notice my absence\|(2A1B2B) People notice my absence]] - although they aren't obviously associated to each other in topic, I noted a connection in the latter note.
