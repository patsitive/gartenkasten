I am most interested in mental health, disability (community) and rehabilitation because of my lived experience, what I have seen from the disabled community through work and also what I am observing of my FIL as a stroke survivor. 

I am solution-focussed, empathetic, compassionate, culturally-aware, a flexible thinker, and I think my corporate background will also help me with this. Plus, my lived experience as a disabled, LGBT, woman of colour helps me empathise with varied populations. Put together, I believe I would excel in any [[Learn in Public/Think/(3B1B1A2) Helping Roles Are Increasing\|Helping roles]] like Occupational Therapy, Counsellor, or Social Worker (or nurse!).
