[**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Personal Knowledge Management allows you to organise and integrate thoughts and files\|Personal Knowledge Management allows you to organise and integrate thoughts and files]]], and semantic linking aims to contextualise why I thought one link was relevant to another note.
