The reverse is also true, as a [**example**:: [[feedback loop\|feedback loop]]]. The [**example**:: [[Zettelkasten as conversation partner\|Zettelkasten as conversation partner]]] also exemplifies this model, as the zettels themselves are expressions of arguments as shaped by other sources and other positions.
