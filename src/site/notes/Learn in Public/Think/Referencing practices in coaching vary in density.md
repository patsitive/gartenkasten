I am observing that of the 30+ articles I've engaged with as part of my [[Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching\|Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching]] that the reference density (how often and how many times a journal articles cites preceding work) varies a lot. Some feel a lot more sparse in citations. I'm unsure if this is because the papers are assuming a lot of what they're stating is common knowledge or because the [**north**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Coaching\|Coaching]]] academic discipline is fairly new and practitioner-driven. 

This has gotten me hyped to do a research project...! [**contributes to**:: [[Tales & Trials/Ideas/Patterns, Pathways, and Power-Bibliometric analysis\|Patterns, Pathways, and Power-Bibliometric analysis]]]
