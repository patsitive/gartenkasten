Weakly written papers can get published. I wonder how they get past peer review? 

This tangentially relates to how [**Prev**:: [[Learn in Public/Think/Referencing practices in coaching vary in density\|Referencing practices in coaching vary in density]]], but my definition of weak writing relates more to the arguments or thread of thought rather than stuffing a journal article with citations to the gills. 

This comes across as shade, but it's really because I wonder if I wrote a paper, could it get published? And would someone out there writing their uni essays call it weak? ðŸ˜‚
