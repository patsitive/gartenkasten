In [[Learn in Public/Reference/@moran12weekYearGet2013\|@moran12weekYearGet2013]], it is observed that most business results are made just before year-end or just before the new financial year. Why is this? Business may set goals in Quarter 1, then lags until Quarter 4, where monumental effort is often made. This phenomenon can also be observed in students, where a mad dash of studying happens towards finals time or the weekend before a project deadline. 

So it's not just having a deadline that creates urgency. If a date is too far in the future, then there's a sense that you can catch up, that you can do it later, that there is still time. 

But a brain can recognise that there is precious little time to squander when faced with short-term deadlines. For neurodivergent people especially, it bypasses the executive dysfunction enough to enable action. 

Similarly, [[Learn in Public/Think/(5A2) Observation Drives Execution\|(5A2) Observation Drives Execution]]. Seeing the deadline move ever closer creates the urgency needed to spring into action.
