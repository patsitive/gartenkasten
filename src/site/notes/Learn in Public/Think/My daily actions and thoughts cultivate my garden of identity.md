[[Learn in Public/Think/Cultivating a garden is continual effort\|Cultivating a garden is continual effort]], so I need to keep planting the seeds of who I want to be and water them, through my thoughts and actions.

But some plants - well, I don't want those plants there at all. Or maybe they're just a bit too big. Like, my love for eating. I see myself as a big eater, a hungry caterpillar. That part of me needs to be pruned back, and I need to make space for the plants representing healthy eating and physical health instead.
