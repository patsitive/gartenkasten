[[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort\|(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort]], and these public notes represent my cottage garden of thoughts and musings-- with lots of beauty and chaos. As a cottage or kitchen garden, it needs to be a 'working garden' that bears fruit, which means I use [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management]] and [[Resources/Zettelkasten Process\|Zettelkasten Process]] to keep at it.

As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts. 

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or life and cultivate and nourish that thought, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

_By the way,_ I think ==pink links== mean the note is _unpublished_ or I chose to keep it private, while **green links** are publicly online, and you can view them. Hope that helps!
