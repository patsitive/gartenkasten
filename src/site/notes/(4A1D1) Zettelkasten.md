A zettelkasten is a style of recording ideas to make it easier to create writing output. You do this by recording atomic ideas in singular notes, recording the source of that idea, as well as linking it to relevant ideas. The [**Prev**:: [[Thinking/Zettels/(4A1D) Zettel form realises its purpose\|(4A1D) Zettel form realises its purpose]]], so that new ideas are always being incorporated into one's web of thoughts. 

For more on zettelkasten, you can go:
- look at Niklas Luhmann's digitised zettelkasten (he popularised the method with his prolific writing)
- read SÃ¶nke Ahrens book How to Take Smart Notes 
- read Bob Doto's book A System for Writing (or his many blog posts on the subject)
- read Dave Kadavy's book Digital Zettelkasten (or his articles or podcast episodes on the topic)
- read the articles or watch the videos of Sascha Fast from zettelkasten.de 

All of these resources will explain the zettelkasten method better than I will because I am merely adopting the method, not trying to teach it (sorry, that's selfish of me, I guess ðŸ˜…)
