As a teenager, my father told me and my then boyfriend that we should not get intimate because "Women are like your favourite food. You will get sick of them, if you have the same one too much." 

I don't remember his exact wording, but I remember feeling disposable. I am not sure what my father was aiming for with his words, but from my observations of his romantic relationships, teenage me felt that his statement rang true. 

<!-- And I remember that I have multiple illegitimate siblings and that one of them was born within months of my brother's birth, which means my father was actively cheating on my biological mother while she was pregnant. (So, he definitely got sick of her!) --> 

While I do NOT agree with this sentiment, it has unfortunately seeped into my subconscious. I find myself obsessing on whether I am interesting / pretty / enticing / upbeat / some other descriptor that I have decided I should be. I'll trawl the internet at 3am, reading yet another anonymous opinion about how to make men happy. I do want to make my husband happy, and he wants to do the same for me. He has never shown any sign of thinking like this, but [**Prev**:: [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden\|this idea is well-rooted]]] and proving difficult to destroy. 

Anyway, I hope he won't say this kind of thing to my teenage sister.
