## Hand-selected spots 
### Explore ideas from these starting points

I'm trying to weave the connections between ideas as deftly as I can. These connections might be explicit (hard-coded in a structured list or in an essay) or contextual (hyperlinked as ontologically related). 

Below are hotspots that make **interesting starting points** for exploring this gartenkasten. Some are short and atomic `zettel`-style, while others might be longform essays or articles.
