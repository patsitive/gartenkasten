# Kia ora, e hoa! 
> _Welcome, friend_: Start here to explore the garden of ideas

## Welcome to my gartenkasten üå±üóÉÔ∏è

<p class="vcard">I'm <a class="fn url" href="https://patsitive.co.nz">Pat Oyson-Matthan</a>, a <span class="title">student and life coach</span> living in <span class="adr"><span class="region">Waikato</span>, <span class="country-name">New Zealand</span></span>, and this digital 'garden-box' is where I shake off my fear and learn in public: by sharing ideas and exploring what delights and challenges me.</p>

> Gartenkasten is my whimsical portmanteau of these two thinking and writing models! 
> - '**digital garden**' (`garten`) ‚Äî where ideas are expected to evolve and interconnect 
> - '`zettelkasten`' (**slip/note box**) ‚Äî where ideas are atomic and branch off each other 

(Notice how the term is German‚Äîand I _don't_ speak it‚Äîso I've skipped the 'digital' part üòÖ German, I love you for your elegant modularity)

### Start Here 

Much like a cottage garden, this space is messy, magical, and you never know what will pop up next. 

If you're curious about **what even is this**, please start here: 
- What is a [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1A3) Digital garden\|(1A1A1A3) Digital garden]]?
- What is a [[Thinking/Zettels/(4A1D1) Zettelkasten\|(4A1D1) Zettelkasten]]?
- [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden\|(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden]]
- [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A41) Note types in MY zettelkasten\|(1A41) Note types in MY zettelkasten]]
- [[How to navigate the gartenkasten\|How to navigate the gartenkasten]]

**As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts.** 

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or life‚Äîand cultivate it, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

> _By the way,_ **[[pink links\|pink links]]** either mean that the note is _unpublished_ or _private_ OR they mean it's an *external* link (not sure how to make the distinction clear atm), while **[[Thinking/Welcome to my gartenkasten\|green links]]** are public, and you can view them. 

#### Here I explore: 
- Identity
- Self-narratives
- Professional coaching 
- Systems thinking
- Mental health 
- Whimsy and cosiness as antidote to hustle culture 
- ...anything else that tickles my fancy!

### Established plants ‚Äî explore ideas from here

I'm trying to weave the connections between ideas as deftly as I can. These connections might be explicit (hard-coded in a structured list or in an essay) or contextual (hyperlinked as ontologically related). 

Below are hotspots that make **interesting starting points** for exploring this gartenkasten. Some are short and atomic `zettel`-style, while others are longform evergreen essays. 

- [[Thinking/Zettels/(1) I am a writer\|(1) I am a writer]]
