## Welcome to my gartenkasten 🌱🗃️

Gartenkasten is my whimsical portmanteau of 'digital garden' and 'zettelkasten'!

**Garten = garden, Kasten = box/crate in German => Garden in a box => [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden\|Wild thoughts grow _somewhat_ contained in a digital box]]**

I could have also added something about digital at the start... German is so cool in its modularity, but I don't know German, and Gartenkasten is fun to say... 😅).

#### What's in my garden?

**As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts. **

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or life—and cultivate it, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

_By the way,_ [[pink links\|pink links]] mean the note is _unpublished_ or _private_, while **[[Thinking/Welcome to my gartenkasten\|green links]]** are public, and you can view them.
