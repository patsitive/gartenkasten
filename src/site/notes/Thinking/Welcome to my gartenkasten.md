# Kia ora, e hoa!

## Welcome to my gartenkasten 🌱🗃️

Gartenkasten is my whimsical portmanteau of 'digital garden' and 'zettelkasten'!

(I could have also added something about digital at the start... German is so cool in its modularity, but I don't know German, and Gartenkasten is fun to say... 😅)

#### What is all of this? 

- **Garten = garden + Kasten = box/crate in German => Garden in a box**
- **What is a [[Digital garden\|Digital garden]]?
- What is a [[Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]]?
- [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden\|(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden]]
- [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A41) Note types in MY zettelkasten\|(1A41) Note types in MY zettelkasten]]
- [[Resources/Zettelkasten Process\|Zettelkasten Process]]
- [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1D1A) Flow of zettelkasten\|(1A1D1A) Flow of zettelkasten]]

**As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts.**

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or life—and cultivate it, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

_By the way,_ [[pink links\|pink links]] mean the note is _unpublished_ or _private_, while **[[Thinking/Welcome to my gartenkasten\|green links]]** are public, and you can view them.
