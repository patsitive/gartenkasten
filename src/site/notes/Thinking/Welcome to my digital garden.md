[[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort\|(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort]], and my public notes represent a cottage garden of thoughts and musings-- with lots of beauty and chaos. 

As a cottage or kitchen garden, it needs to be a 'working garden' that bears fruit. I use [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management]] and [[Resources/Zettelkasten Process\|Zettelkasten Process]] to develop my thinking and hopefully bear fruit in the form of writing, visuals and videos. 

</div></div>


As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts. 

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or life and cultivate and nourish that thought, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

_By the way,_ I think [[pink links\|pink links]] mean the note is _unpublished_ or I chose to keep it private, while **green links** like [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B) My Thoughts Are A Cottage Garden\|this one]] are publicly online, and you can view them. Hope that helps!
