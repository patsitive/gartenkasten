[[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort\|(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort]], and my public notes represent a cottage garden of thoughts and musings-- with lots of beauty and chaos. 

As a cottage or kitchen garden, it needs to be a 'working garden' that bears fruit. I use [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management]] and [[Resources/Zettelkasten Process\|Zettelkasten Process]] to develop my thinking and hopefully bear fruit in the form of writing, visuals and videos.

- **ðŸŒ¿ Thought Note** â†’ A micro-essay or single idea. Also known as a _zettel_ in the Zettelkasten forest. New leaf, fresh thought.
- **ðŸŒ¸ Visual Note** â†’ An idea expressed as a visual: charts, doodles, or diagrammed thinking. When an idea blossoms _visibly_.
- **ðŸ¦‹ Identity Note** â†’ Notes on self-reflection, self-storying, and transformation. Butterfly as metamorphosis.
- **ðŸš© Source Note** â†’ A note on something Iâ€™ve read, watched, or learned from. The root system feeding the garden. (There was no root emoji...)
- **ðŸªµ Log Note** â†’ A longer-form piece, shipped project, or polished output. The mature tree, now harvested and logged.



**As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden of thoughts. **

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or lifeâ€”and cultivate it, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

_By the way,_ [[pink links\|pink links]] mean the note is _unpublished_ or _private_, while **[[Thinking/Welcome to my digital garden\|green links]]** are public, and you can view them.
