Completing tasks is a function of corralling your executive function, so that your brain actually lets you do 'the thing'. So if you aren't able to complete an action, then that suggests your executive function skills aren't able to support you in initiating, progressing through and completing 'the thing'. 

This isn't to say that we cannot do hard things.

Tasks in 'real life' are seldom as engaging, as well-scaffolded into your systems or as designed to facilitate completion. Like washing dishes, getting to work on time, or paying your taxes.

Some argue that it doesn't matter if it's hard or not, it needs doing, so just do it. Okay, sure, but telling me that doesn't mean I'll get it done. It just means an internal script on loop saying 'You can't wash the dishes? You're a piece of trash. Go die.' Making things easier for me to initiate, continue with or complete tasks does not make me a bad person; it means I am learning to work with my brain in a self-compassionate manner. After all, [**contributes to**:: [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B1) My Daily Actions And Thoughts Cultivate My Garden Of Identity\|(1A1A1B1) My Daily Actions And Thoughts Cultivate My Garden Of Identity]]], so I am on a mission to seed the garden with compassion and considered effort.
