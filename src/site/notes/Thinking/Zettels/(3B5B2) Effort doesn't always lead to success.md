[[Thinking/Zettels/(3B5B) Coachee Attitude Modulates Coaching Efficacy\|(3B5B) Coachee Attitude Modulates Coaching Efficacy]], and [[Thinking/Reference/@Johnson2021CoachabilityDevelopmentCoachability\|@Johnson2021CoachabilityDevelopmentCoachability]] suggests that more effort leads to more success. I disagree with this sweeping statement because effort applied to misaligned objectives and unhelpful actions won't necessarily lead to desired outcomes. 

Counterpoint: Small, targeted effective changes like [[Keystone Habits\|Keystone Habits]] may lead to greater impact at a fraction of the effort exerted.
