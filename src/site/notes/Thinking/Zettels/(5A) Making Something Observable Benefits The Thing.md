Making something observable benefits the thing. 

Turning [[tacit knowledge\|tacit knowledge]] into [[concrete knowledge\|concrete knowledge]] is often a known bottleneck for knowledge workers and organisations. How much information is stored in our heads that we end up sharing in informal ways? How much information is then lost to the vagueness of memory, changes in personnel, etc. 

Personally I often find that I *believe* I've learned something (and perhaps I have); however, I later find myself having to relearn the same concept.

Why do I end up needing to relearn the concept? 
- due to the passage of time, I've forgotten - because there is no record of my understanding of the concept (eg notes that break down my understanding), and I can't quickly re-activate my understanding. 

The same thing happens in organisations. [[Thinking/(0) Structure/Knowledge Management\|Knowledge Management]] comes to the fore, particularly, when someone realises that vital information has gone missing. 

But if you make something observable (which means, [[Thinking/Zettels/(5A1) You Need To Be Able To See Inside A System OR Measure It To Observe It\|(5A1) You Need To Be Able To See Inside A System OR Measure It To Observe It]]), then that consequently means, you gain the following benefits: 
- accountability
- feedback
- visibility
- clarity 
- scalability

This thinking has applications in [[systems thinking\|systems thinking]], personal knowledge management and also effectiveness of organisations. 

In [[Thinking/Reference/@moran12weekYearGet2013\|@moran12weekYearGet2013]], the author adds that [[Monitoring And Measuring Builds Self-Esteem\|Monitoring And Measuring Builds Self-Esteem]] because progress is documented and made visible.
