I am a voracious reader. Whether I read five pages in a year or 10 books in two days, I know in my heart I am a reader. Comics, scholarly articles, manga, tweets, blog posts, erotica, self-help, business -- give me the gamut of the library. I am a devourer. 

I'll read at a festival, at a party, in the car while waiting, standing in line, deep in the late hours of the night, as dawn breaks. When any time permits. 

Or I'll let books gather dust, pixels decay and memories of plots and strategies fade into nothingness. 

I read frenetically, words pass my eyes before I can sound them out. Or I savour each word and return to the same line again. Then again. And still again. 

I'm not a purist. No way. 

Give me paperback, e-paper, blue-light-emitting screens or even words blared tinny out of my mobile phone, barely audible over the roar of the open road. 

Just give me the words of others.

There is no movie playing in my head (thanks, aphantasia), but words are still my escape and respite. 

And I guess because I read, then that's why [[Thinking/Zettels/(1) I Am A Writer\|(1) I Am A Writer]].
