I get hungry fast and often, despite eating what seems like a lot of food. There's a lot of 'food noise' that goes on in my head. I would like the noise to quiet down, and to do that, I think I need my stomach to feel full longer (without gorging myself). It's important that I work on my health because you [**Prev**:: [[Thinking/Zettels/(2A1B2) Care For Yourself\|(2A1B2) Care For Yourself]]]. 

According to [[ChatGPT MoC\|ChatGPT MoC]], there's a rule of 5 to help with that
- protein
- fibre 
- healthy fats 
- hydration
- crunch / chew 

I need to work on fibre and crunchy factor the most. 

I find that [**example**:: [[Thinking/Zettels/(1B2A1) If a task isn't getting done, it isn't 'ease-y' enough\|(1B2A1) If a task isn't getting done, it isn't 'ease-y' enough]]]. In the case of calorie inputs, I feel like I need to do the perfect thing (track calories by the gram). Then if I don't do _that_, then I don't do anything at all. So what if I apply an 'ease-y' solution? 

#### Proposed solution: 
Prepare a crunchy salad that I can dump on my regular food, to improve satiety. 

Hard part: Buy items from grocery, chop everything up  (once a week)
Ease factor: Grab and dump
