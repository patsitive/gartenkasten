I previously thought about the [**Prev**:: [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A4) Zettel as micro-essay\|(1A4) Zettel as micro-essay]]], but now I see that I was thinking about two different kinds of notes. Since I see the [[Zettelkasten as conversation partner\|Zettelkasten as conversation partner]], it makes sense that I have shaped the conversation to suit my needs and thinking style. 

This is what my zettelkasten contains: 

| Type              | Emoji | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Location                                                         |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌱 Seed Note      | 🌱    | **Literature or Reference note** which references the ideas coming from a specific source, e.g. book, journal article, podcast. <br><br>_Seeds turn into plants and leaves._                                   | /Thinking/Reference                                              |

| 🍃 Cutting Note   | 🍃    | **Atomic note**, which describes a singular, modular idea in my own words, ideally including a reference to the seed. <br><br>_A single cutting is complete for propagating new plants, i.e. modular, atomic._ | /Thinking/Zettels                                                |
| 🌿Plant note      | 🌿    | **Micro-essay** note, which synthesises related atomic ideas. To be transformed into separate cuttings.                                                                                                        | /Thinking/Zettels                                                |
| 🦋 Butterfly note | 🦋    | **Reflection Note** → Notes on self-reflection, self-storying, and transformation, personal takes, memories, queries. Butterfly as metamorphosis.                                                              | /Thinking                                                        |
| 🪵 Log note       | 🪵    | **Creative output**, like a longer-form piece, shipped project, or polished output. The mature tree, now harvested and logged.                                                                                 | /Thinking/Log (used to be Tracts? change Tracts folder, unclear) |
| 🌸 Flower note    | 🌸    | **Visual Note** → An idea expressed as a visual: charts, doodles, or diagrammed thinking. When an idea blossoms _visibly_.                                                                                     | /Thinking/Zettels                                                |

### ✨If You Wanted to Add Light Gamification...

Just some optional flair that might vibe with your brain:

| Gamification Idea                      | How                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌱 **Seed to Flower Tracker**          | Add a property to Zettels like `Stage: Seed → Cutting → Plant → Flower`                                             |
| 🦋 **Butterfly Metamorphosis Counter** | Add a `last_edited` property to see which butterflies you’re actively evolving                                      |
| 🚢 **Shipping Log**                    | Tag `#shipped` + link to deliverables. Maybe even include a ship emoji in the filename? e.g. `🚢 30 Ships - Day 12` |
| 🗺️ **Signpost Board**                 | A canvas or MOC (Map of Content) visualising your current quests/projects/thoughtlines                              |
