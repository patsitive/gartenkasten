"Serious play" is a phrase I've heard before, but I've finally written it down as part of [[Thinking/Reference/Faery (2005) 21W.735 Writing And Reading The Essay\|Faery (2005) 21W.735 Writing And Reading The Essay]]. 

"Serious play" like any game should be challenging and engaging, and we should be committed in the work. These conditions sound like [[flow state\|flow state]], and it's no wonder then that [[Thinking/Zettels/(1B2) Gamers Easily Reach Flow State\|(1B2) Gamers Easily Reach Flow State]]. That mindset allows them to persist in challenges. For example, [Foldit Gamers Solve Riddle of HIV Enzyme within 3 Weeks | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/foldit-gamers-solve-riddle/)

If we must be committed to the work, that suggests discipline. Therefore, even though writing can be fun, it can also be excruciating - because [[Writing Is A Discipline\|Writing Is A Discipline]]. 

Question for later: [[How do we define what is Great Work?]
