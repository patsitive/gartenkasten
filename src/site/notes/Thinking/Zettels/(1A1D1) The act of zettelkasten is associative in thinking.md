Working within your zettelkasten, you are thinking about associations to other thoughts or notes. The folgezettel is one way to track associations. [[]] and is another way of thinking associatively. 

For example: 
[[]] is related to [[\|]] is related to [[]] - 1A branched from 1 through folgezettel 
[[]] also relates to [[\|]] also relates to [[]] - although they aren't obviously associated to each other in topic, I noted a connection in the latter note. 

**Prev**:: [[]]
