Working within your zettelkasten, you are thinking about associations to other thoughts or notes. The folgezettel is one way to track associations. [[${2}\|${2}]] and is another way of thinking associatively. 

For example: 
[[Thinking/Zettels/(1) I am a writer\|(1) I am a writer]] is related to [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A) Writers Are Made Through Writing And Reading\|(1A) Writers Are Made Through Writing And Reading]] - 1A branched from 1 through folgezettel 
[[Thinking/Zettels/(1) I am a writer\|(1) I am a writer]] also relates to [[Thinking/Zettels/(2A1B2B) People notice my absence\|(2A1B2B) People notice my absence]] - although they aren't obviously associated to each other in topic, I noted a connection in the latter note.
