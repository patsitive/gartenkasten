I was trained in [[Thinking/Zettels/(3B) Coaching\|(3B) Coaching]] methodology at Ministry of Social Development New Zealand. I also learned through reflective practice when I coached staff in the moment (like how [[${2}\|${2}]]) or in formalised coaching sessions as well as in a reflective practice group, which was so handy during the COVID 2020 pandemic. 

I am formalising my theoretical understanding via [[Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching\|Graduate Certificate in Professional Coaching]]:

I am currently researching [[Efforts/Patterns, Pathways, and Power-Bibliometric analysis of the citation practices shaping the field of professional coaching (1970-2020)\|Patterns, Pathways, and Power-Bibliometric analysis of the citation practices shaping the field of professional coaching (1970-2020)]]
