The act of logging what is, has, and will happen orients you to event time because time is recorded in relation to activities (or _events_). It also orients you to clock time because it requires awareness of the passage of time - where you are able to, you should record accurate timestamps. But even inaccurate records force you to consider when activities are located in the span of a day (a rough estimate is better than nothing, especially when considering executive dysfunction). 

In a way, interstitial journalling allows you to sidestep the decision of [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B1B1) Operating In Clock Time Vs Event Time\|Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B1B1) Operating In Clock Time Vs Event Time]].
