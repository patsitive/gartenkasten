# Welcome to the garden of my thoughts!

[[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort\|(1A1A1B2) Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort]], and these public notes represent my cottage garden of thoughts and musings-- with lots of beauty and chaos. As a cottage or kitchen garden, it needs to be a 'working garden' that bears fruit, which means I use [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management]] and [[Resources/Zettelkasten Process\|Zettelkasten Process]] to keep at it. 

As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden. 

If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a physical garden, you can take a 'cutting'. Take the thought with you into your own notes or life and cultivate and nourish that thought, until it bears its own fruit and flowers. 

Want to know who these thoughts belong to?

How else do I apply the garden metaphor?
