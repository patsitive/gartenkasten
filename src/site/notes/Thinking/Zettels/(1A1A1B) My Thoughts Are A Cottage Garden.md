Welcome to the garden of my thoughts!

[[Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort\|Cultivating A Garden Is Continual Effort]]- and these public notes are a cottage garden of my thoughts and musings, with lots of beauty and chaos. As a cottage or kitchen garden, it needs to be a 'working garden' that bears fruit, which means using [[Thinking/Zettels/(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management\|(1A1A1A) Personal Knowledge Management]] to keep at it. 

As a guest, you are welcome to explore this garden. If any of my thoughts inspire you, then much like a true garden, you can take a cutting. Take the thought with you into your own notes, blog or other use case and cultivate and nourish that thought, until it bears its own fruit and flowers.
