The [[\1\|\1]] can't seem to be extricated from the [[\1\|\1]] because [[\1\|\1]] and as a result how you describe what it is almost always talks about what it is meant to do. 

Here's how I have defined coaching: 
[[\1\|\1]]

The process itself needs to take into account its purpose: making meaningful progress in the life of the coachee. 

However, if you describe something like basketball, you could say it is a ball sport played on a court with two teams (why did I pick a sport I know nothing about). If you ask someone what is the purpose of basketball, you might get answers like: 
- to have fun
- to make friends 
- to win 

But you cannot divorce coaching from the purpose of empowering change. Without change, it is no longer coaching.
