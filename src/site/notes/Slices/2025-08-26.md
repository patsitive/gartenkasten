#### 🗓️ [Daily Log 2025-08-26 ]
- [IndieWeb video call](https://indieweb.org) — it was so fun to meet new people and ask questions about IndieWeb! 
- Thinking and planning how to work on [[Learn in Public/Create/Digital Garden Plugin documentation\|Digital Garden Plugin documentation]] 
- Walk with Luna and hubby 
- Editing the IndieWeb wiki — I think I made 6 edits today? 🤪😂 
- Bouncing on my mini rebounder! 🤸‍♀️
-  
- Somehow broke Mermaid code support for my gartenkasten? 
- Installed Note ID plugin for Obsidian!!!! 
- Worked on my [[Learn in Public/Gartenkasten colophon\|Gartenkasten colophon]] — it's not up yet (although maybe by the time you see this, it is up? Evergreen links are mysterious like that)
- Nearly threw up because I got so nauseous 🤢 I was so excited that I forgot to eat breakfast AND lunch, and 2 coffees did not help 🙃
