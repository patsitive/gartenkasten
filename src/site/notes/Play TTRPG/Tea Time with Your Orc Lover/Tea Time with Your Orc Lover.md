### Solo Roleplayer Diary

#### 2025-11-30

First, I've decided to start a roleplayer diary to capture my thoughts about my campaign as I go. I think it might be fun to look back on later hehe. 

Also!!! I've decided that I will consider the 'campaign' as finished when Sampaguita finishes setting up her caravan and opening it up to the public for customers; she doesn't have to have started travelling yet. (I'll make that the plot of the next campaign) I am making this change because for some reason it is actually taking a long time to set up this caravan??? and instead of rushing it, I actually want to take my time. That feels more Iron Valley. And doing this means I can intentionally start doing more romance elements now, instead of 'waiting' for the story to 'start'. I think I was fixated on getting the carriage on the road because I literally started by picking up the Wandering Tea Garden solo journalling game. But it is okay!!!! I guess I could consider this just a story arc, but I like the idea of considering it 'completed'. And then I can decide if I want to pick it up again and do the wandering tea garden stuff after — but then I won't need to immediately pick up from when Sampaguita opened her tea shop. This is really motivating me to play this more. I kinda want to go back to old scenes and play them out more ayieeeee fun!
