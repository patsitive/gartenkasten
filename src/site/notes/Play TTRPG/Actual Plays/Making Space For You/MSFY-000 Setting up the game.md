### Welcome to my Actual Play!

OMG hi, kia ora and mabuhay, fellow nerd! 

This is an Actual Play, which means it is a log of me roleplaying a tabletop game. I'm sharing my Actual Plays because I thought it would be fun for people to join me on my fictional adventures. 

Maybe these logs will entertain you, give you ideas or make you want to send me irate emails—maybe I messed up a rule? ignored something obvious?!—whatever it might be, I hope you get something out of me sharing with the ~internet~.

### Actual Play Style
> [!info] Actual play style
> This actual play series tries to keep separate the **roleplay** from the **gameplay**, for convenience. 💗
> > [!info] **Roleplay**
> > I will attempt to focus more on action and dialogue of the roleplay than the style of my writing. 
> > (I'm not sure how successful I'll be at this 🤔 — but the idea is to speed up play, while paying attention to story beats. This is an experiment!) 
> 
> > [!info] **Gameplay** 
> >Detailing game elements like dice rolls, Oracle pulls, moves, inventory changes and my commentary will be contained in callouts and written as bullet points.

### Events

#### World Truths
- I needed to decide on some World Truths! 

##### World of fantasy species 
- World Truths: This Iron Valley has fantasy species living in the game world. It also has some magic. Also favour economy is preferred, but I may roleplay using precious metals for currency as well!
	- **💭 Commentary:** I have bended the Iron Valley setting rules to suit my narrative. Is this a bad move as a newbie? Time will tell.

##### Reason for moving
- Character Truth: I am leaving the big city because... Estranged aunt has invited you to stay with her. It's been years since your whole family lived in Aurora together... before mum and aunt had that big fight...
	- **💭 Commentary:** Why did you leave the big city? IDK. I just felt like this would make an interesting backdrop? 

##### Moving to 
- Character Truth: Where are you staying in town? In Aunt's house

##### Stats 
- Character Truth: [[Play TTRPG/2. Characters/Player Characters/Amaya/PC-Amaya#Stats\|Amaya's stats]] are [Heart: 2, Iron: 2, Shadow: 1, Wits: 3, Edge: 1]
	- **💭 Commentary:** I decided on what stats to have for Amaya based on the stat values allowed: [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. Here's what I picked and why: 
		- Heart: 2 — That fight between Mum and her Aunt really shook her up. She's scared of ruining relationships and treads carefully; she wants people to be happy. 
		- Iron: 2 — Dad treated Amaya like a son, in that as his eldest child she was the strong pair of hands he could count on. 
		- Shadow: 1 — Amaya is pretty straight-laced and very much unmagical 
		- Wits: 3 — Thinking things through has never let her down. Except, when she overthinks and doesn't act and that leads to problems, but Amaya doesn't think about that. Much. Well, tries not to.
		- Edge: 1 — Could Amaya outrun someone? Hmm, maybe not. 

##### Starting Skills 
- Character Truth: Amaya's skills are First Aid, Inquire, and Creature handling
	- **💭 Commentary:** What skills might help Amaya in Aurora? I am going to pick from the skills and not randomise this!!! Here are my picks: 
		- 🛠️ [[Play TTRPG/2. Characters/Player Characters/Amaya/PC-Amaya#Skills\|Starting Skills:]] First Aid — Amaya never wanted people to know if she got hurt, so she got really good at patching herself up. 
		- 🛠️ [[Play TTRPG/2. Characters/Player Characters/Amaya/PC-Amaya#Skills\|Starting Skills:]]  Inquire — As an overthinker _and_ people pleaser, Amaya has learned the art of asking in a way that people _want_ to answer. This is the upgraded skill. 
		- 🛠️ [[Play TTRPG/2. Characters/Player Characters/Amaya/PC-Amaya#Skills\|Starting Skills:]]  Creature handling — While Dad specialised in caring for holy pigeons, there was no shortage of animals needing help in the city. She knows exactly how to lift safely and strongly. The best part? Animals love unconditionally. 
	- **💭 Commentary:**  Amaya is going to need to get satisfaction fast because she will need to repair the house ahahaha, ahhh this entertains me

##### Starting Promises 
- Needed to decide on 3 starting promises! 

- Starting Promise - town setting: [[Play TTRPG/2. Characters/Player Characters/Amaya/MSFY-P001-Find out what caused Aurora to get so rundown (6)\|MSFY-P001-Find out what caused Aurora to get so rundown (6)]] 
	- **💭 Commentary:** Since I decided that Aurora is a rundown place, I think this makes sense.  
---
- Starting Promise - where you're staying: [[Play TTRPG/2. Characters/Player Characters/Amaya/MSFY-P003-Fix up Aunt's old house (5)\|MSFY-P003-Fix up Aunt's old house (5)]]
	- **💭 Commentary:** I borrowed this one from the guidebook! I thought it made sense given the condition of Aurora that her aunt's house lso needs fixing up. 
---
- Starting Promise - reason you're moving to Aurora: [[Play TTRPG/2. Characters/Player Characters/Amaya/MSFY-P002-Figure out why Mum and Aunt fought and make peace with their history (8)\|MSFY-P002-Figure out why Mum and Aunt fought and make peace with their history (8)]]
	- **💭 Commentary:**  Uhhh... Amaya knew about the invitation 3 years ago. So I need to think about why she's moving _now_
	- **🔮 Oracle:** Question: Why is she moving now??
	- - Oracle type: Tarot card pull
	- - Result: [![Resources/Decks/Tarot/09-TheHermit.png|srt-flip2](/img/user/Play%20TTRPG/Resources/Decks/Tarot/09-TheHermit.png)]
	- - Interpretation: OMG THIS IS SO FITTING!!!! Loneliness, problem that's hanging over your head ➡️ Get to the bottom of Mum and Aunt's big fight 
	- **💭 Commentary:** [Reversed hermit meaning](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/the-hermit-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings?srsltid=AfmBOoqsnKoh6AfdoZpqXIyJTuUwqokfXbJdjICa4JMdLnPvLeUddQ6q): "When it comes to work, the hermit reversal meaning refers to your preparedness to get to the bottom of something that has been troubling you for quite some time now. There is searching to be done, and it will be your responsibility to ask the question that will allow the other people to understand the circumstances."
	- **💭 Commentary:** Narrative explanation:
		- Amaya is burnout. Too many expectations and too many things to do. But she's scared of something happening — like with Mum and Aunt — and of that happening to _her_. But she's so tired. And maybe if she figures out just what happened years ago when her Mum vowed her Aunt was dead to them — well, maybe, she could stop it happening to her... and maybe reunite her family. Her sisters refused to come; her Mum got so mad, but Dad said he's proud of her. That's something.
		- Originally, Aunt was dead, and she inherited the house. But I'm kind of sick of the dead relative trope lol. And I wanted the hopefulness of a possible reconciliation and how emotionally fraught that can be—like you want it so much, but you're scared it will cost you. But maybe it's worth the risk.

- That's it, folks!

## Reflection 

Okay, this is surprisingly emotional? Not sure how this happened, but I'm vibing with it, although the themes are hitting kinda close to home 🫠😂 

	- Me: I just want a cosy, small town romance
	- Also Me: But make everyone traumatised 

I WILL KEEP THIS COSY. LIKE, OKAY, FEELINGS, BUT GOOD VIBES. LESHGOOOOO.
