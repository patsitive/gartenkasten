## World Truths

- You’re moving to a place known as Iron Valley, where is it?
	- Iron Valley is a state of mind (lol) instead of a town. Instead, the vibes of Iron Valley translate across different locations (but maybe less so in the big cities) — [[Play TTRPG/Actual Plays/Tea Time with Your Orc Lover\|Tea Time with Your Orc Lover]]
	- Iron Valley is _also_ now a small town because I decided to play a new adventure in the same world LOL — [[Play TTRPG/Actual Plays/Making Space for You\|Making Space for You]]
- What kinds of people live in Iron Valley?
	- Sentient people of various species live in this world: humans, orc, elves, gnomes, dwarves. Other species are considered non-sentient, e.g. animals or plants. 
- Is there magic in the world of Iron Valley?
	- There is magic in the world, which you feel in the elements and channel through potions and runes. Magical effects can be felt through food and drink as well. All have magic but some are more adept than others.

- Bartering favours and errands is the preferred method to exchange goods and services. 
- For any creatures or animals (fictional or real-world), their most renowned quality or trait will be enhanced. 
	- Donkeys are much stronger in this world and can move at a regular pace (slow) or even trot, canter or gallop if ridden. 
	- Horses are still the preferred riding companion and carriage-drawer, but this is more to do with status or looks than ability of either equine species. 
- There is some electricity and electrical appliances, but these are magical in nature. 
- Sending letters by post or pigeon is how people communicate, unless your voice carries.
- Humans are 4'11 to 5'4 in height, typically.
