Goal: Get out of Arrivals Sector—waiting out the process will take a long time. Maybe speed it up by teaming up with a crew and doing a job.

Achieved by completing [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/Score a Package for Kirk\|Score a Package for Kirk]] — which the Crew ended up giving to [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Sessions/Cam\|Cam]] instead.
