## Summary 
Mysterious fixer offers us the chance to speed up entry into Mapouriki—with a quick score

## Goal
[[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/Get into Mapouriki\|Get into Mapouriki]]

## Log
**Location: [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/LOC-Arrivals Sector\|LOC-Arrivals Sector]]**

- Alice has been stuck in the [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/LOC-Arrivals Sector\|LOC-Arrivals Sector]] of [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/LOC-Mapouriki\|LOC-Mapouriki]] the floating city for a while. It's been roughly two months already, and she's dying for a hot bath and to go dancing. Honestly, she's questioning the decision to even try to get into Mapouriki. Life wasn't so bad in the US. For her, anyway. 
- The weather is overcast and there's smog in the air. It's the middle of the day in the slum-like sector. Alice would love to go sunbathing, but this is not the time nor place for it. 
- [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/Doc Halo\|Doc Halo]] passes the time by playing cards with one of the [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/Red Crown\|Red Crown]] guards. He plays honestly first to lull the guard into a false sense of security. 

> Doc Halo **finesses** his gambling (I think)
```
d: Success 
=> He later cheats his way into winning. The guard goads him by reminding him that he's heading home to Mapouriki while he's stuck here.
``` 

- Elsewhere, [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/Morgan\|Morgan]] is looking around, checking out the Arrivals Sector. She runs into a young boy who starts talking to her. He's clearly begging for something, even though she can't understand him. He seems to be speaking an Asian language. She gives him some money, and they figure out that the kid speaks English. He lets her know that he and some other children were exploring and they found a tunnel (maybe it's a way into the city?). But a maintenance drone spooked them away. 

> Alice goes to the Processing Hall to get info 
- At the same time, [[PC-Alice\|PC-Alice]] decides to head to the Processing Hall, which has a large automated speaker spouting useless canned announcements. It takes hours, but she eventually gets to the front of the line where she talks to a smiling, robotic immigration officer. It's chipped and tagged and tells her (in the most obviously robotic voice) that it will take 3 months, 2 weeks and 5 days for her visa to be processed. That's way too long. 

> Alice tries to **Interface** with the robot 
```
d: 2d6[5,5] (I think) -> Partial success. 
=> Alice hacks in and obtains the prints for the network architecture around the Arrivals Sector. There are lots of hard cables, but oops she makes a mistake. 
=> Error. Error. Beeps the robot. She attracts the attention of a guard, and she leaves.
```

- The three all go to the bar in the evening and get together, swapping stories. 
- Two men approach them. One is in fluorescent pastel, and the other is beefy and portly and is clearly the hired muscle.
- The [[Play TTRPG/Blades Cyberpunk/Details/Kirk\|former]] wants them to hit a cargo ship named SS Andrea and grab an item. He hands them an RFID scanner to locate the item, saying they need to drop off the package at a tunnel and that he has supplies for them. 

- Rules: 
	- Be gentle with the package
	- Do not let the Red Crown follow you.
- Things to know: 
	- Red Crown guard the perimeter
	- There are fewer guards on the ship. 
	- Drones in the tunnels won't bother us. 
	- We might have seen him before. He is not affiliated with the Red Crown.

- Morgan and Doc Halo follow the client. 

> Morgan **prowls** to follow, with Doc providing an assist.

```
d: Fail.
=> She fails and falls. Luckily for her, no harm and no stress. But the client is gone.
```

> Alice explores the perimeter closer to ship. 
- The ship is old school. There is security around the cordon. She spots a data terminal. 

> Alice uses **Interface** on the data terminal. 

```
d: 2d6[1,3] (I think) -> Fail. 
=> An alarm goes off, she has tripped the system. 
```

> `DM started a Clock with six phases, due to the alert.`

- All go to van to meet-up. They discover that the client's name is Kirk is the client. They grab supplies. 

> Alice prepares her loadout: 
> Discrete (4 boxes)
> Declare heavy: Climbing gear (2 boxes)

> [!note] Discussion 
Doc Halo will act as distraction. Alice and Morgan will climb up the crane to then abseil onto the ship. Doc Halo may not need to get on the ship as well, players to communicate over comms. Make sure to leave space in the loadout for weapons. GM advises to avoid killing the Red Crown.
