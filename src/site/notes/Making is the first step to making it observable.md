To observe something, there must be a thing to [[Learn in Public/Think/(5A) Making Something Observable Benefits The Thing\|observe]]. 

So before you try and dissect and prod and try and change a "thing", make sure it exists first. 

If it is a system, write it down. Then you can observe it and do something with it. 

If it is an idea, write it down. Then you know its edges and corners and can do something with it. 

Make sure to [[Learn in Public/Think/(5A1A) Record To Make Findable\|record it]] in your [[Learn in Public/Think/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management]] system!
