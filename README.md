# ðŸŒ¿ Patsitive gartenkasten 

**Welcome to my 'Gartenkasten'** (my whimsical portmanteau of 'digital garden' and 'zettelkasten'!) 

Garten = garden, Kasten = box/crate in German => Garden in a box => Wild thoughts grow _somewhat_ contained in a digital box 

I could have also added something about digital at the start... German is so cool in its modularity, but I don't know German, and Gartenkasten is fun to say... ðŸ˜…).

## Tech stack 
This website runs on a few moving parts: 
- [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md/)â€”for writing and containing ideas in Markdown files
- [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden)â€”pushes changes from ObsidianMD vault to website via GitHub 
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden)â€”builds and deploys website when changes are pushed
- [Topobon](https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/tree/main)â€”adds pretty visual garden view of notes to the header.

## How to setup 
I know, it's so cool, right? Very Indie Web. I used the following to set things up: 
- [dg-docs.ole.dev](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) for how to set up the Digital Garden plugin and Vercel
- [Topobon issue #33](https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/issues/33) for notes on integrating Topobon into your garden (you do not need to fork the whole thing if you already have a digital garden set-up)
- [Swamp website stack](https://www.paologabriel.com/swamp/website-stack/#a-href-https-hermitage-utsob-me-target-blank-class-external-link-hermitage-a-forest) for extended instructions on deploying Topobon (and also where I saw Topobon in the real world)
- To change the images for the garden map, you need to update the `noteLabels` in `userUtils.js` and update CSS as well

P.S. I updated the README in case anyone else wanted to use the same setup ðŸ’–
